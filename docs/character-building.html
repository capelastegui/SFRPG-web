<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Character Building</h1>
<p>This chapter provides the rules for creating and levelling Player Characters.
The overall character creation process is first described, and then each
creation and levelling step is discussed in detail: stat generation, Origin
and class selection, mundane equipment, feat selection, levelling up, and
using magic items.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Character Creation Overview</h2>
<p>From the initial character concept to the point where the character sheet is
complete, there are several decisions that a player must take in order to
create a first level character. In this section, we explain the character
creation process as a whole, and a more detailed discussion of each step is
provided later on.</p>
<p>The basic steps for creating a character are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Character concept and story</li>
<li>Origin and Class selection</li>
<li>Ability generation</li>
<li>Skill selection</li>
<li>Equipment selection</li>
<li>Feat selection</li>
<li>Power selection</li>
<li>(Levelling)</li>
</ol>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: Although beginning players are encouraged to follow
the character creation steps in order as listed above, it is quite possible to
go back and forth between steps, as each decision provides new inspiration and
ideas to improve on previous choices. Furthermore, since the number of
available options may get overwhelming for inexperienced (and not so
inexperienced) players, we provide pre-built sample characters that can be
played as-is, or used as basic templates to be customized to taste. These
sample characters, along with suggested level-up options up to level 30, can
be found in the Classes chapter.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Ability generation</h2>
<p>Once the player has decided on a character class and a class build, the
Abilities for the Player Character can be generated. To do this, the player
selects a Primary and a Secondary ability, and then assigns scores to each.
These choices are usually conditioned, if not fully determined,
by the character’s class build:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Primary Ability</strong> is the character’s strongest and most important
Ability, used for most attacks. Most class builds have a fixed Primary
Ability.</li>
<li>The <strong>Secondary Ability</strong> adds useful bonuses to several character Powers
and Class Features. Many class builds have a predetermined Secondary Ability,
though some provide a choice between two or three options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assign the following scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>+4 to Primary Ability</li>
<li>+3 to Secondary Ability</li>
<li>+0 to to other Abilities</li>
</ul>
<div class="compatibility">
<strong>Compatibility Note</strong>: Under legacy rules,
PCs used to get Ability increases from their Origin (then called Race),
as well as from levelling up. This is no longer the case, but see the
Ability Skill Bonus section below.
</div>
<div class="compatibility">
<strong>Compatibility Note</strong>: The only remaining way to
increase Ability Scores is through Epic Destinies. However, whenever
an Epic Destiny from an older rulebook provides a bonus to an Ability score,
that bonus is halved (typically from +2 to +1).
</div>
<div id="wide-ability-array-advanced-rule" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Wide Ability Array (Advanced rule)</h3>
<p>The set of Ability scores described above is known as the
<strong>Default Ability Array</strong>, and should be a good fit for the majority of
characters. However, some character builds may have ability requirements that
are spread across many abilities, usually due to heavy multiclassing or to
being non-conventional designs from early legacy sourcebooks. For those cases,
and with approval of the GM, a player may choose instead the
<strong>Wide Ability Array</strong> - choose one Primary Ability and <strong>two</strong> Secondary
Abilities (instead of just one, as usual), and assign the following scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>+3 to Primary Ability</li>
<li>+3 to Secondary Ability</li>
<li>+0 to to other Abilities</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: We recommend new players to ignore the
<strong>Wide Ability Array</strong>. Even experienced players should stay away from this
most of the time - it’s just offered as a patch from some old classes that
would otherwise be very difficult to play.
</div>
</div>
<div id="tertiary-ability-and-weak-ability-optional" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Tertiary Ability and Weak Ability (Optional)</h3>
<p>As an option, players can choose two Abilities that are not Primary nor
Secondary to be their Tertiary and Weak Abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Tertiary Ability</strong> is an Ability with a slightly above average score.</li>
<li>The <strong>Weak Ability</strong> is an Ability that sees little to no use for the
character, and has the lowest score. Class builds should provide suggestions
for suitable Weak Abilities, but the choice is otherwise up to the player.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assign the following scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>+1 to Tertiary Ability</li>
<li>-1 to Weak Ability</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Having a Tertiary and Weak abilities very slightly
increases a PC’s effectiveness, but it’s not really a required step in
character generation. New players are encouraged to skip this step until they
have a good grasp of the rules of the game and the impact of changing these
ability scores. We recommend GMs to allow selection of Tertiary and Weak
abilities at a later point in the game, such as after reaching Level 2.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="skill-bonuses" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Skill Bonuses</h2>
<p>There are 12 Skills in the game that determine how good a character is at
different activities. For each skill, the associated Skill Bonus is generated
as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Skill Bonus = Ability Skill Bonus + Skill Training Bonus + Armor Penalty + Other Modifiers</code></pre>
<p>Each of these modifiers is explained in a separate section below.</p>
<p>The following table shows all 12 Skills with their corresponding Abilities and
a summary of what they are used for. For a detailed description of Skills and

<div id="ability-skill-bonus" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Ability Skill Bonus</h3>
<p>Each Skill has an associated Ability, which is used to determine the
Skill Bonus. However, rather than directly adding ability scores to the
Skill Bonus, we use a related value, called the Ability Skill Bonus. Unlike
Ability scores, which remain constant after a character creation, an
Ability Skill Bonus can be affected by the character’s Origin, and increase
as they level up.</p>
<p>For each Ability, the corresponding Ability Skill Bonus is generated as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Ability Skill Bonus = Ability + Origin Ability Modifier + Ability Skill Points + Other Modifiers</code></pre>
<p>An explanation for each :
- <strong>Ability</strong>: Ability Score
- <strong>Origin Ability Modifier</strong>: Modifier to that Ability Skill Bonus from the
character’s Origin. Typically, Origins add +1 to 2 fixed Ability Skill Bonuses
- <strong>Ability Skill Points</strong>: Players get to assign extra points to add to their
Ability Skill Bonus as they level up - see the table below.
- <strong>Other Modifiers</strong>: Characters can gain additional modifiers from Feats or
Magic Items, among other sources.</p>
<p>Ability Skill Points are gained at levels 4, 8, 14, 18, 24 and 28. When a
PC reaches one of these levels, they choose an Ability and add 1 to the
Ability Skill Points assigned to that Ability Skill Bonus, as shown
in the table below:</p>
<p>Level | Points gained | Score Limit
4 | +1 | +2
8 | +1 | +3
14 | +1 | +3
18 | +1 | +4
24 | +1 | +4
28 | +1 | +5</p>
<p>Players are restricted in the abilities they can choose to increase their
Ability Skill Points: only abilities where the sum of Ability Score and
current Ability Skill Points are below a certain value (shown in column Score
Limit of the table above) can be chosen this way. Other bonuses, such as
the Origin Ability Modifier, are not counted towards the Score Limit.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Example - Ability Skill Bonus for a Level 1 PC.
Gimli is a Level 1 Dwarf Warrior with +4 Str, +3 Con, and +0 to other
abilities. Origin Ability Modifiers for a Dwarf are +1 Con, +1 Wis. This
character will have the following Ability Skill Bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Str: +4 (Ability)</li>
<li>Con: +3 (Ability) +1 (Origin) ; Total: +4</li>
<li>Dex: +0 (Ability)</li>
<li>Wis: +0 (Ability) +1 (Origin) ; Total: +1</li>
<li>Int: +0 (Ability)</li>
<li>Cha: +0 (Ability)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p>Example - Ability Skill Points.
The character from the previous example levels up. When he reaches level 4, he
can gain an Ability Skill Point on any ability other than Str and Con.
He chooses to add a point to Wis. Ability Skill Bonus for Wis at Level 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wis: +0 (Ability) +1 (Origin) +1 (Points); Total: +2</li>
</ul>
<p>At level 8, he can add an Ability Skill point on any ability other than Str.
He chooses Con this time. Ability Skill Bonus for Con at Level 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Con: +3 (Ability) +1 (Origin) +1 (Points); Total: +5
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="skill-training" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Skill Training</h3>
<p>Depending on their class, Player Characters can choose a number of Skills to
become Trained in them. Characters gain a +3 bonus to Skill Checks with
Trained Skills, and Skill Checks of Hard Difficulty are only available to
characters with training in that Skill.</p>
<p>In order to select a Player Character’s Skills, the player should look look at
the Class Skill List for the character’s class, as well as the Racial Skill
List for the character’s Origin. Any Skill in either of these lists can be
selected as a Trained Skill for the character. The player then looks at the
number of Trained Skills allowed by the character’s class, and selects that
many Trained Skills.</p>
<div class="compatibility">
<strong>Compatibility Note</strong>: The Racial Skill rule
replaces racial Skill bonuses from older rulebooks. When a Origin provides
a numeric bonus to one or more Skills, consider instead that these Skills
are Racial Skills. Any other Skill-related benefit, such as gaining Training
with a specific Skill, remains unchanged.
</div>
<p>Some Origins and Classes provide automatic training with predetermined Skills.
In that case, the character first gains training with these skills, and then
the player selects Trained Skills as usual.</p>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: When selecting Trained Skills, it is usually a
good idea to prioritize Skills that match the character’s Primary or Secondary
Abilities. If you end up with training in two or more Skills associated with
your Tertiary or Weak Abilities, consider taking Unnatural Ability as a Lesser
Feat when you level up, in order to compensate for the lower Ability scores in
these Skills.
</div>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: As your character levels up, you can expand your
Trained Skill selection by taking Skill Training as a Lesser Feat.
Alternatively, you can specialize on your best Skills by taking Skill Focus
as a Lesser Feat.
</div>
</div>
<div id="armor-penalty-to-skill" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.3</span> Armor Penalty to Skill</h3>
<p>Some types of armor have an Armor Penalty value
(typically -1). This penalty applies to Skill Checks for Athletics, Endurance,
Finesse, and Stealth. See Armor in the equipment section of this chapter
for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-skill-bonuses" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4</span> Other Skill Bonuses</h3>
<p>Characters can gain additional modifiers from Feats or Magic
Items, among other sources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="equipment-selection" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Equipment selection</h2>
<p>A character’s class determines which weapons, implements and armor the
character is proficient with. Upon creation, every character starts the
game with the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to three weapons the character is proficient with.</li>
<li>An armor the character is proficient with.</li>
<li>Up to one implement the character is proficient with.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, starting characters get mundane equipment that has no impact on
their stats and powers, including clothing, adventuring supplies, food, and
money. The specific details should vary based on the character’s background
and the context of the initial adventure, and be the result of a dialogue
between player and Game Master. We suggest, by default, providing characters
with food for a week of travel, money to cover living for a month, and a
non-exhaustive list of items to carry with them, such as bedrolls, rope, and
torches. In addition, whenever a more unusual item of reasonable weight and
cost is needed, we recommend the Game Master to assume that a character is
carrying it, provided that the player can come up with a convincing explanation.</p>
<div class="design">
<p><strong>Designer Note</strong>: Some games aim to provide a detailed
simulation of economy in a fantasy world. This is not such a game. We believe
that keeping track of the specific contents of a player’s backpack or the
balance of each economic transaction are not critical to the game experience.
Instead, we recommend players and Game Masters to keep inventories vague and
flexible, outside of player rewards like Magic Items, or items of special
importance to the game plot.</p>
That said, if you favor more detailed rules for economy, there are tables
with recommended item costs and weights from other game systems, such as
D20SRD (<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/equipment.htm" class="uri">http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/equipment.htm</a> ) and 13AGESRD
(<a href="http://www.13thagesrd.com/equipment" class="uri">http://www.13thagesrd.com/equipment</a> ), which are freely available online.
You can use these tables as a reference for setting item prices in your
campaign.
</div>
<p>In the rest of this section, we list the weapons, armor and implement available
in the game, along with a description of their rules.</p>
<div id="weapons" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1</span> Weapons</h3>
<p>Each weapon in the game is described by the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Family</strong>: A category of weapons with similar properties. For example, Axes
is a weapon family that includes hand axes, battle axes, and greataxes.</li>
<li><strong>Damage</strong>: Base damage dealt per weapon damage die.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: Special properties associated with the weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: How much training is required to wield the weapon, determines
which classes can use it.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: Whether it is a Melee or Ranged weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Hands</strong>:Whether the weapon requires 1 or 2 hands to be wielded.</li>
</ul>
<p>A character’s class determines which weapons the character is trained to use.
A character using a weapon without training does not benefit from any of the
weapon’s properties, including damage, keywords, and any magic abilities.
Instead, the weapon is treated as an Light Improvised Weapon if it requires
one hand to wield, or a Heavy Improvised Weapon if it requires two hands.
Improvised weapons can be used without training.</p>
<div class="compatibility">
<strong>Compatibility Note</strong>: In older rulebooks, weapon
training is referred to as weapon proficiency, and weapons can have a
Proficiency Bonus to hit, if the character is trained with them. This
Proficiency Bonus no longer exists, and any mentions to it should be
ignored.
</div>
<div id="weapon-families" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1.1</span> Weapon Families</h4>
<p>The following weapon families are supported in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Axe</strong>: Melee weapon consisting of a heavy edged head and a handle.</li>
<li><strong>Bow</strong>: Ranged weapon consisting of a strip of wood or other flexible
material and a string, used to shoot arrows.</li>
<li><strong>Crossbow</strong>: Ranged weapon consisting on a bow mounted on a stick and a
mechanism to hold the string. Used to shoot bolts.</li>
<li><strong>Flail</strong>: Melee weapon consisting on a blunt or spiked head attached to a
handle by a chain or rope.</li>
<li><strong>Hammer</strong>: Melee weapon consisting of a heavy blunt head and a handle.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy Blade</strong>: Melee weapon with a long and heavy blade</li>
<li><strong>Improvised</strong>: A common object used as a weapon, or a weapon used without
training.</li>
<li><strong>Light Blade</strong>: Melee weapon with a short or slender blade</li>
<li><strong>Sling</strong>: Ranged weapon consisting of a pouch and a string, used to throw
stones or bullets.</li>
<li><strong>Spear</strong>: Melee weapon consisting of a pointed head attached to a long shaft.</li>
<li><strong>Staff</strong>: Melee weapon consisting of a long wooden shaft.</li>
<li><strong>Unarmed</strong>: A character’s own body used as a melee weapon.</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: Weapon Family is of special relevance in relation to
the Weapon Focus category of Feats, as these Feats often give bonuses when
wielding any weapon of a specific family. Advanced players are encouraged to
study the different Feat bonuses when considering their weapon of choice. For
beginning players, we suggest instead to choose based on aesthetic preferences
- you can always use the Retraining rule to rethink your choice at a later
point.
</div>
</div>
<div id="weapon-keywords" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1.2</span> Weapon Keywords</h4>
<p>The following weapon keywords are supported in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Off-Hand</strong>: The weapon can be wielded in the off-hand while another weapon
or object is wielded in the main hand.</li>
<li><strong>Parry</strong>: A character wielding one or more weapons or shields with Parry
gains +1 to AC against Melee and Close attacks. The bonus from multiple
instances of this keyword does not stack.</li>
<li><strong>Ranged</strong>: Ranged weapons have the Range keyword, followed by a number
indicating the Weapon Range. Characters can make Ranged and Area attacks
up to a distance equal to the Weapon Range without penalty. In addition,
characters can make Ranged (but not Area) attacks at long range, to distances
between Weapon Range and twice the Weapon Range, with a -2 penalty to hit.</li>
<li><strong>Reach</strong>: Weapons with reach increase the Melee Reach for attacks made with
them by a certain amount. A medium-sized character typically has a Melee
Reach of 1, which increases to 2 with a Reach +1 weapon, and to 3 with a
Reach +2 weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Throw</strong>: Melee weapons with Throw can be used to make Ranged and Area
attacks as well as Melee and Close attacks. The Throw keyword is followed by
a number indicating the Weapon Range. Characters can make Ranged and Area
attacks up to a distance equal to the Weapon Range without penalty. In
addition, characters can make Ranged (but not Area) attacks at long range,
to distances between Weapon Range and twice the Weapon Range, with a
-2 penalty to hit. After using a Ranged or Area attack power with a Throw
weapon, choose a character targeted by the attack. The weapon is placed on
the ground in a square in the character’s space. Magical Weapons with Throw
are automatically returned to the wielder’s hand after each attack instead.</li>
<li><strong>Unwieldy</strong>: Attacks made with this weapon gain a -1 penalty to hit.</li>
<li><strong>Versatile</strong>: When wielded on the main hand with a free off-hand, this
weapon deals +1 damage per weapon damage die. This increases to +2 damage
per weapon damage die at level 16.</li>
<li><strong>Very Unwieldy</strong>: Attacks made with this weapon gain a -2 penalty to hit.</li>
</ul>
<div class="compatibility">
<strong>Compatibility Note</strong> In older rulebooks, Throw
weapons can be classified as Heavy Thrown or Light Thrown. Treat any mention
to either of these as referring to Throw weapons instead.
</div>
</div>
<div id="weapon-hands" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1.3</span> Weapon Hands</h4>
<p>The hand requirements to use a weapon are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-handed weapons without the Off-Hand keyword</strong> can be wielded in the
character’s <strong>main hand</strong>. The character can wield another item, such as
an Off-Hand weapon, an implement or a Shield, in the Off-Hand.</li>
<li><strong>One-handed weapons with the Off-Hand keyword</strong> can be wielded in the
character’s <strong>main hand or off-hand</strong>. The character can wield another item,
such as an Off-Hand weapon, an implement or a Shield, in the other hand.
When making an attack, a character can choose to use either the main hand
weapon or the Off-Hand weapon - there are no penalties for Off-Hand attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Two-handed weapons</strong> require both hands to be wielded. A character cannot
use a hand to wield any other item while wielding such a weapon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One-handed versatility</strong> : A character wielding a One-Handed weapon while
leaving the other hand free can choose to take a -1 Hit penalty on an attack
with that weapon to gain a +1 bonus to the weapon damage (scaling with Weapon
Damage Multiplier). When they do, that weapon counts as Two-Handed for the
purpose of powers or abilities that care about weapon types.</p>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: It is usually better to use two-handed weapons, or
One-handed weapons with a free hand or a Light Shield, if you want your
character to focus on the offense, and a one-handed weapon with a Heavy
Shield if you prefer focusing on defense. Wielding a weapon in each hand
offers you extra flexibility, but otherwise it does not grant additional
attacks or any other inherent benefits, so it is usually not a good idea,
unless you have class Powers or Features that require dual wielding or
otherwise reward you for it.
</div>
</div>
<div id="weapon-tables" class="section level4">

<p>Some character classes use unique weapons not available to other classes. In
these cases, stats for these weapons should be provided within the class rules.</p>
<div class="compatibility">
<p><strong>Compatibility Note</strong>: Some weapon types from older
rulebooks are no longer supported. As a general rule, we recommend treating
any such weapon as a currently supported weapon of the same Family, Training,
Type, and Hand requirements, if available. Some cases of particular interest
are:</p>
<p>Two previously existing weapon families, Picks and Maces,
have been discontinued. We recommend replacing Picks with Axes of similar
properties, and replacing Maces with Hammers of similar properties.</p>
<p>Some weapons used to have the same name as their weapon family. To remove
this ambiguity, they have been renamed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spear</strong> is now Halfspear</li>
<li><strong>Crossbow</strong> is now Light Crossbow</li>
<li><strong>Flail</strong> is now Light Flail</li>
</ul>
<p>Some character classes from older sourcebooks have bonuses associated with
obsoleted weapon types. We recommend the following replacements for these
weapons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sickle</strong>: replace with Dagger</li>
<li><strong>Scimitar</strong>: replace with Short Sword</li>
<li><strong>Club</strong>: replace with Mace</li>
</ul>

<div id="armor" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2</span> Armor</h3>
<p>Each armor in the game is described by the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong></li>
<li><strong>AC bonus</strong>: Bonus granted to a character’s AC for wearing the armor
with training.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: Whether the armor is Light Armor or Heavy Armor, or a Shield.</li>
<li><strong>Armor Penalty</strong>: Penalty granted to Ranged and Area attacks and many Skills.</li>
<li><strong>Movement Penalty</strong>: Penalty granted to a character’s Speed (for all
available movement types).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each character can wear one suit of Light Armor or Heavy Armor. In addition,
each character can use one Shield. Characters wearing nothing but plainclothes,
or wearing no clothes, are considered as wearing Cloth Armor. Using a shield
takes up one hand, and characters cannot wield weapons or implements nor
carry objects with their shield hand.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Penalty</strong>: Some types of armor have an Armor Penalty value
(typically -1). This penalty applies to Hit rolls of Ranged and Area attacks,
as well as Skill Checks for Athletics, Endurance, Finesse, and Stealth.</p>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: Characters focused on Ranged and Area attacks should
consider carefully whether the added protection of Heavy Armor is worth taking
the Armor Penalty to hit. As a rule of thumb, a +1 to Hit on all attacks is
worth more than a +1 to defend against half of enemy attacks (since armor does
not protect against attacks targeting Fortitude, Reflex or Will).
</div>
<p>A character’s class determines which armors the character is trained to use.
A character using an armor without training does not benefit from any of the
armor’s properties, including AC bonus and any magic abilities. However, any
Armor Penalty or Movement Penalty imposed by the armor still applies. All
characters are considered to be trained in the use of Cloth Armor.</p>
<p>A character using a Shield and wearing Light Armor or Heavy Armor can add the
AC bonuses from shield and armor.</p>
<p>Some character classes gain an additional bonus to AC while wearing Light Armor.
This is called Light Armor AC Bonus. Some classes also have class features
that grant a bonus to AC, and these can stack with their Light Armor AC Bonus.
A table summarizing Light Armor AC Bonus and other stats for all classes
currently in the game (including classes from older rulebooks) is provided in
this chapter, in the Origin and Class Selection section.</p>
<p>To summarize, a character’s AC is calculated as follows:</p>
<pre><code>AC= 10 + Armor bonus + Shield bonus + Class Light Armor bonus</code></pre>
<p>Note that these are the most common types of AC bonus, but other bonuses
granted by specific Class Features, Feats, or Powers can still apply.</p>
<div class="compatibility">
<strong>Compatibility Note</strong>: Unlike other defenses, a
character’s Abilities provide no bonus to that character’s AC. In older
rulebooks this was not the case, and it was common to have character classes
whose Class Features allowed using an Ability as a bonus to AC while wearing
Light Armor. Ignore these bonuses, and any other mention of an Ability bonus
to AC. Fixed bonuses to AC that do not depend on a character’s Abilities still
apply as normal.

<div id="armor-types" class="section level4">

<p>The different types of armor available in the game are described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light Armor
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloth</strong>: Regular clothing, or Robes</li>
<li><strong>Leather</strong>: A combination of regular clothing and leather pieces for
added protection, such as a leather jacket or coat, a leather suit, or

</ul></li>
<li>Heavy Armor
<ul>
<li><strong>Hide</strong>: A combination of regular clothing, leather pieces, and thick
pieces of beast skin for added protection.</li>
<li><strong>Chain</strong>: Armor made of interlocking metal rings.</li>

<li><strong>Plate</strong>: Armor made of large metal plates.</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="implements" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.3</span> Implements</h3>
<p>Each implement in the game is described by the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hands</strong>: Whether the implement requires a hand, two hands, or no hands at
all to wield.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: Special properties associated with the implement.</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: base range for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks made with the
implement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, unlike weapons, implements do not have an associated damage die.
Damage in implement attacks is not affected by the choice of implement. The
only mechanical differences between implements are their hand requirements,
the bonuses provided by their associated Implement Focus Feats, and the range
for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks (but not for other ranged attacks). The
rules for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks are in the Stat Generation section
of this chapter.</p>
<p>A character’s class determines which implements the character is trained to
use. A character wielding no implement, or wielding an implement without
training uses the “No Implement” stats, which include a -2 penalty to hit
due to the Very Unwieldy property. A character using an implement without
training does not benefit from any of the implement’s properties, including
damage, keywords, and any magic abilities.</p>
<div id="implement-types" class="section level4">

<ul>
<li><strong>Staff</strong> - Long shaft, usually made of wood.</li>
<li><strong>Wand</strong> - Short, slender stick.</li>
<li><strong>Rod</strong> - Long, decorated stick.</li>

<li><strong>Weapon Implement</strong> - Weapon that can be used to channel supernatural powers.
Some character classes allow specific types of weapons to be used as Weapon
Implements. Weapon Implements require the same number of hands to wield as
their associated weapons.</li>

<p>A Feat is a character customization option that lets player specialize their
characters beyond their Origin, Class, and Power selection. Each Feat provides
a significant improvement to the character’s combat capabilities. Characters
start the game with one Feat, and gain additional ones as they level up, to a
maximum of nine. On top of that, characters may gain bonus feats from other
sources, such as their Origin or Class. Depending on the specific case, a
character gaining a bonus Feat may be able of picking any available Feat of a
certain level or lower, or of picking any feat within a given Feat Category,
or just gain a predetermined Feat.</p>
<p>Each Feat is composed of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: The minimum level at which the Feat can be acquired. Also, the
minimum level of the Feat Slot that can be used to learn the Feat.</li>
<li><strong>Category</strong>: A group of Feats that perform a similar function. A character
can only select a single Feat from each Feat Category.
Some Feat Categories are labeled as “Unlimited”. A character can select any
number of Feats from an Unlimited Category</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: A series of labels that describe the Feat. Feat Keywords are
purely descriptive and have no associated rules, but are sometimes referenced
by other Feats.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements</strong>: A series of conditions that a character must meet before
taking the Feat.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The benefits granted by the feat.</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: An abbreviated version of the Feat Description, used in summary
tables. The Summary text does not necessarily provide exact or complete
rules, and should only be used as a quick guide for character building
decisions, not as a rules reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to regular Feats, characters can also gain Lesser Feats, which are
customization options that usually improve a character’s adventuring
capabilities but have little or no impact in their combat performance.
Through Lesser Feats, characters can expand their knowledge in Skills,
Rituals, or languages. Characters start the game with no Lesser Feats but
acquire them as they level up, to a maximum of nine. On top of that,
characters may gain bonus Lesser Feats from other sources, such as their
Origin or Class, or other Feats. Depending on the specific case, a character
gaining a bonus Lesser Feat may be able of picking any available Lesser Feat
of a certain level or lower, or just gain a predetermined Lesser Feat.</p>
<p>Each Lesser Feat is composed of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: The minimum level at which the Lesser Feat can be acquired.
Also, the minimum level of the Lesser Feat Slot that can be used to learn
the Lesser Feat.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Whether the Lesser Feat can be taken multiple times.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: A series of labels that describe the Feat. Feat Keywords are
purely descriptive and have no associated rules, but are sometimes referenced
by other Feats.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements</strong>: A series of conditions that a character must meet before

<p>Each Feat Slot can be used to gain a Feat with a level equal or lower to that
of the Feat Slot. Likewise, each Lesser Feat Slot can be used to gain a Lesser
Feat with a level equal or lower to that of the Lesser Feat Slot. Note that
Feats and Lesser Feats are not interchangeable: a Feat Slot cannot be used to
gain Lesser Feats, nor can a Lesser Feat slot be used to gain Feats.</p>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: Although the power level of Feats tends to grow with
their level, the differences are sometimes very small. Often, a lower level
Feat will be just as effective for a given character as the higher level
alternatives, if not the best option altogether.
</div>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: At some levels, a Feat Slot can only be filled with
lower level Feats.
</div>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip</strong>: If you are lost, or want to experiment, choosing
legal Feats at random is still expected to yield competent (if unfocused)
characters.
</div>
<div class="compatibility">
<strong>Compatibility Note</strong>: Feats from older rulebooks
are considered obsolete and should not be used. This is not, strictly speaking,
due to compatibility issues (since the Feats should mostly work under the
current rules), but as a way to improve the game experience - see the
Designer’s Note below for a detailed explanation. That said, Game Masters who
wish to incorporate older Feats into their campaigns can do so with minimal
translation effort, as long as they are aware that they risk breaking design
assumptions about combat length and difficulty, and class balance.
</div>
<div class="design">
<p><strong>Designer Note</strong>: Experienced players may find this
Feat system too restrictive compared to those of previous games. However,
these restrictions serve an important purpose. Here is the reasoning behind
them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Separation between combat options and adventuring options</strong>: Allowing
characters to freely choose between combat and non-combat Feats results in
excessive performance variability, to the point that it’s virtually
impossible to design high level content that will be moderately difficult
and enjoyable to both characters that are completely specialized on combat
and characters that only select non-combat Feats. Furthermore, it is usually
optimal to ignore either combat or non-combat options (depending on the
campaign), resulting in roughly half the Feats in the game seeing little
to no play. By splitting customization slots between combat options (Feats)
and non-combat options (Lesser Feats), we get much more predictable character
outcomes, which allow for a better high level game experience. This also
allows players to improve both their combat and non-combat capabilities
without feeling that they are hurting their character’s potential.</li>
<li><strong>Feat categories</strong>: It is a natural thing for players to experiment with
spending all of their customization resources in improving a single dimension
of their character, such as damage, or defenses, or even mobility. Again,
this leads to excessive variability between high level character builds
and, as a consequence, high variability in game difficulty, combat length,
and overall game experience. By classifying Feats into functional Categories,
and restricting players to one Feat per Category, we can, for example,
provide dozens of options to increase attack damage while ensuring that a
given character will only be able to have two or three of them at once.</li>
<li><strong>No support for previous Feats</strong>: We wanted every Feat in the game to have
a purpose, and to be playable for a significant percentage of character
builds. However, older rulebooks had thousands of Feats with wildly
inconsistent quality and power level. We decided that starting from
scratch and having a compact set of Feats that could realistically be
tested and polished was the best option.</li>
<li><strong>No class/Origin requirements</strong>: We wanted the total number of feats to
be manageable for players, but also to maintain backwards compatibility
with previous Origins and Classes. Since older rulebooks have dozens of
Origins and Classes, and including Feats for only a subset of them would
be considered unfair and introduce balance issues, we chose to remove
racial feats altogether and replace Class Feats with options based on
Class Role and Power Source, which fill a similar niche with much less effort
and complexity. That said, we might reconsider this for future supplements.
