In this game, a group of friends can take the role of a party of adventurers exploring a fantasy world, fighting rampaging monsters, and discovering ancient treasures. We recommend playing this game in groups of 4 to 6 players. 2.1.1 What is a Role Playing Game? Square Fireballs is a Role Playing Game, that is, a game where players use their imagination to represent characters in a simulated world. Players sit on a table, and use rulebooks, pen, paper and dice to resolve character actions and keep track of game progress. There are two types of players in these games: Player Characters: Each Player Character (abreviated as PC) has a character with their own unique background, personality, and set of skills. Player Characters get to decide what actions their characters take, but not necessarily the outcomes of these actions - those are determined by the rules of the game and usually involve a random element like rolling dice. Game Master: The Game Master, or GM, is in control of the game world: its environments and history, and all characters other than the Player Characters (which are known as Non-Player Characters, or NPCs). The Game Master’s responsibility is to present interesting scenarios and challenges for the players to overcome. In each game session there must be one Game Master. A Role Playing Game is composed of a set of game rules, which provide a framework to resolve the character’s actions and their interactions with each other and with the game world. Another component that is often present is a description of the game setting: the people and places that PCs can interact with. This is used as a reference by GM and PCs alike to better understand what is going on in the game, and how their characters should behave. In addition, many games also include suggestions on how to run a game, explanations of the game philosophy, and other pieces of advice. Role Playing games are usually played in game sessions of a few hours of duration. Player groups that meet regularly can have a persistent continuity across game sessions, following the adventures of a cast of recurring characters over extended periods of time - this is known as a game campaign. Unlike board games and most computer games, Role Playing Games do not have a fixed set of goals or win conditions. Rather, a GM presents Player Characters with a series of scenarios, often involving but not limited to the resolution of missions and quests. The Player Characters are not obligated to achieve these missions, but are encouraged to do in order to aquire wealth and fame within the game world (or, more rarely, out of sheer nobility and heroism). On the other hand, it is quite possible for characters to die in the game, and a party of PCs can, in fact, lose the game when all their characters are dead. It should be noted, though, that although the GM is in control of the PCs’ enemies, a GM’s goal in the game is not to defeat the PCs, but to present them with challenging encounters, to enforce the game rules with fairness, and to make the game as fun as possible for everyone. The risk of beloved characters suffering, or even dying, is just a valuable tool to achieve an engaging and memorable game experience. 2.1.2 Why Square Fireballs? Why did we choose to call our game Square Fireballs? What does that even mean? The following figures illustrate the reasoning behind the name: In this game, whenever a combat encounter comes up, characters are arranged on a gridded map in order to keep track of their relative positions. This can be done by using miniatures to represent each character, or other means such as cardboard tokens. The grid map is composed of squares - each square being the minimum unit of distance in the game. Typically, each character fits in a single square, though other character sizes are also allowed. Each character can move a certain number of squares during a game turn, and make melee attacks to enemy characters in adjacent squares. A character’s ranged attacks have a maximum range measured in squares. Diagonal movement across squares in the map is handled just the same as horizontal or vertical movement - just count the number of squares crossed - which introduces some interesting distortions to the map geometry. And this brings us back to the figures above, and the Square Fireballs. You see, this is a game set in a fantasy world where heroic adventurers such as fighters, rogues and wizards battle hordes of monsters like orcs and goblins. The figure to the left depicts a wizard (leftmost square) facing four goblins and an orc (to the right). Now, wizard characters are famous for their ability to conjure offensive spells to blast groups of enemies. The right figure shows one such spell, a Lesser Fireball, centered on the unfortunate orc, and producing an explosion that damages everything in adjacent squares - including the orc’s four goblin buddies. Observant readers will note that, due to the geometrical liberties we have taken in our choice of map representation, the aforementioned ball of fire is rendered as a perfect square. The author’s questionable sense of humor found this fact funny enough to use as the name for a blog and, years later, as the title of a game. And this is why you will soon be playing a game called Square Fireballs, and why goblins don’t like to walk close to each other. 2.1.3 Why should you play this game? In the decades since the invention of role playing games, there have been plenty of game systems based on the same basic concept of adventuring in a fantasy world. Many of them are great. Some introduce highly innovative ideas in their rules or settings. Most of them are prettier than the one you hold in your hands. Why, then, should you keep reading this particular book and spend your valuable time learning a fairly complex set of rules? The defining features of Square Fireballs are rich tactical combat, flexible and straightforward rules for non-combat interactions, and easy preparation of game sessions and characters. Of these, I believe that the star of the show is the combat. It is a deep system that rewards careful positioning, teamwork, and resource management. It offers a great deal of variety, in options for building and playing characters, as well as in the range of available monsters, and in the ways of interacting with the environment. And yet, I have taken great efforts to make the rules as accessible and consistent as possible, while removing any complexity above the strictly necessary. The rules for handling challenges outside of combat are a different beast altogether. All interactions share the same simple resolution mechanic, and there are always multiple paths to achieve an objective. Creative thinking, planning and collaboration are rewarded, and there are clear guidelines for handling failures and allowing the game to move forward. Finally, the game goes to great lengths to reduce the effort and difficulty of setting up a session. Characters are highly customizable, but players are always offered a default option, and all choices are close enough in effectiveness that even choosing at random should result in a competent and enjoyable adventurer. Monsters are likewise easy to customize, and random generation of monsters and encounters is both supported and encouraged. Characters have levels that determine their overall power, but the progression is smooth enough that adventurers and monsters of a wide range of levels can take part in the same session in a satisfying way. It’s only fair to mention that Square Fireballs is not a perfect system, nor is it a game for everybody. There is a strong emphasis in combat, and while I believe that the non-combat mechanics are solid enough, players that are not interested in fighting monsters will be missing a huge part of the system. The design prioritizes gameplay over realism, and players that look for accurate simulations of fantastical societies and ecosystems will probably not find what they are looking for in here. And the game lacks an actual setting, and leaves Game Masters to borrow their world descriptions from other sources - though, on the bright side, it has been designed to be quite flexible in that regard, and be able to fit in anything from high fantasy to nonmagical medieval adventure. All of these disclaimers aside, I honestly believe there is a great time to be had in here. If you are at all excited by the notion of incinerating goblins, pushing ogres off cliffs, triggering trapped chests, grappling with dragons, finding legendary swords, talking to mysterious strangers in taverns, arguing with kings, leaping from the shadows, performing miracles, getting stabbed, bitten, cursed, imprisoned, poisoned, petrified or swallowed whole… this may be the game for you. 2.2 A note on text format We use different styles of text to differentiate between game rules and definitions, and other types of content. Here is a quick summary: Normally formatted, black text is used to describe game rules. Italics are used to provide non-mechanic related descriptions: flavor, backstory. Text in white boxes is used to define formulas. Blue text is used to provide advice on how to play the game. It is typically preceded by “Tip” or “Example”. Gold text is used to provide compatibility instructions to integrate material from older sourcebooks. It is typically preceded by “Compatibility Note”. Red text is used to provide insight into the designer’s ideas regarding a game element. It is typically preceded by “Designer’s Note”. 2.3 Rolling Dice For any non-trivial action that a character performs in the game, success is not guaranteed. We use dice to determine the outcomes of these actions. There are three main types of dice rolls in the game: Checks: Used to determine whether an action is a success or a failure. Damage Rolls: Used to determine the amount of damage (or, more rarely, of healing) that a character takes. Action Point Checks: Used to determine if a character can use an Action Point. Square Fireballs, like many role playing games, uses special dice with different number of sides: Twenty-sided dice, or d20 Four-sided dice, or d4 Six-sided dice, or d6 Eight-sided dice, or d8 Ten-sided dice, or d10 Twelve-sided dice, or d12 D20s are always used for Checks. D4s are used for Action Point Rolls. Damage rolls can use d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s or d12s - the specific dice used by a character at any given type depends on that character’s choice of weapons and powers. Sometimes the game requires a player to roll severall dice at once as part of a damage roll. In these cases, the number of dice is written before the type of dice. This way, 2d6 means rolling two six-sided dice, whereas 5d10 means rolling five ten-sided dice, and 9d4 means rolling nine four-sided dice. When a single die is rolled, no number is required: d12 means rolling one twelve-sided die. The type of dice required for a damage roll in an attack made with a weapon can vary depending on the weapon used. Longswords use d8s, whereas Greatswords use d12s, daggers use d4s, and so forth. In the game, we use ‘W’ to refer to the damage dice of a weapon attack: W means one die, 2W means two dice, 3W means three dice, and so on. When making an attack with a weapon, replace the W with the appropriate type of dice used by that weapon: A ‘W’ attack with a Longsword rolls d8, a ‘2W’ attack with a Greatsword rolls 2d12, and a ‘7W’ attack with a dagger rolls 7d4. 2.3.1 Rolling Checks There are several types of checks in the game that a character can make: Attack Rolls: Used to determine whether an attack hits or misses. Rolled as part of an Attack Action. Skill Checks: Used to determine whether an interaction with other characters or the environment is a success or a failure. Rolled as part of a Skill Action. Saves: Used to resist a harmful condition. Some effects allow characters to automatically attempt a Save at the end of their turns. These are known as ‘Save Ends’ effects. In addition, some powers allow a character to Save against certain effects. The general method to resolve a check is to roll a d20, add the character’s bonus to that check (if any) and any modifiers that apply, and compare the result with a target number. If the result is equal or greater than the target number, the check is a success, otherwise, the check is a failure. For Attack Rolls, the attacking character rolls a d20, adds the character’s Hit bonus for that attack and any attack modifiers that apply, and compares the result with the defending character’s Defense attribute that is appropriate for that attack. There are four different defense attributes: Armor (Ar), Fortitude (For), Reflex (Ref) and Will (Wil). This process is described in more detail in the Combat chapter. For Skill Check, the character making the check rolls a d20, adds the character’s Skill bonus for the Skill used in that action, and any skill modifiers that apply. The result is compared with a number based on the Skill Check Difficulty. This process is described in more detail in the Skills chapter. For a Save, the character making the save rolls a d20, and adds any modifiers that apply. If the result is equal to or greater than 11, the Save succeeds, otherwise it is a failure. This process is described in more detail in the Combat chapter. 2.3.2 Damage Rolls The process of rolling damage varies depending on whether the damage was caused by a PC or a monster, as described in the following sections. After rolling damage, modify the damage by any resistances or vulnerabilities that apply, as described below. 2.3.2.1 Rolling Damage Rolls - PCs Damage rolls use different rules depending on whether they are made by a PC or a monster. We explain the rules for PC damage rolls here, and monster damage rolls in the next section. Unlike check rolls, damage rolls do not use a single d20. Instead, a variable number and type of dice is used for each damage roll, depending on the damaging attack and the weapon used. To resolve a damage roll, roll all the Damage Dice required for the attack, and add them together. Then, add to that total the Ability Bonus to damage for that attacks well as any other Damage Bonuses that apply. High level characters then apply multipliers to the damage dice and ability bonus based on their level: Damage = (Damage Dice X Dice Multiplier) + Ability Damage Modifier + Damage Bonuses Ability Damage Modifier = Ability Bonus * Ability Multiplier The level progression for the Dice Multiplier and the Ability Multiplier are shown below for convenience. A more detailed description of these stats is provided on later sections of this chapter Level Dice Multiplier 1 x1 6 x1 + Fraction Bonus 16 x2 21 x2 + Fraction Bonus 26 x3 28 x3 + Fraction Bonus 30 x4 Level Ability Multiplier 1 x1 4 x1.5 9 x2 11 x2.5 14 x3 17 x3.5 19 x4 21 x5 24 x6 27 x7 29 x8 Note - Fraction Bonus : On some levels, the Dice Multiplier should have fractional values (e.g. x1.5 at Level 6) in order to reach the expected values. Since we don’t want players making excessively complex operations in the middle of the game, we instead add a fixed value that approximates the required number. This value is called Fraction Bonus, and varies with the type of dice rolled, as shown in the table below: Die type Fraction Bonus d4 +1 d6 +1 d8 +2 d10 +2 d12 +3 The Fraction Bonus is added to the value of each die, after applying any multiplier. Example - Dice Multiplier: Gimli makes an attack with a damage dice of 1d8, and rolls a 5. If Gimli is level 16, the total damage for that die will be 5x2=10. If Gimli is level 21, a Fraction Bonus would apply, so total damage would be 5x2 + 2 = 12. If Gimli uses a different attack with damage dice of 2d8, and rolls a 5 and a 7 (total of 12 before modifiers) , at Level 21 the total damage would be 122 + 22 = 28. If you write down the damage for each power on your character sheet, we recommend to include any multipliers and damage bonuses that apply. A 2d8 damage power at Level 21 could be written down as: 2d8 (x2) + 4 , meaning that you would need to roll 2d8, multiply the result by 2, and add 4 to the total due to the Fraction Bonus. Optional Rule If you prefer it, and with the GM’s approval, you can multiply the number of dice rolled instead of the final values. We don’t recommend this because rolling too many dice can be unwieldy and time consuming, but some players find it fun. Tip: Character HP and damage doubles every 10 levels, so a level 30 character will have HP and damage values 8 times as high as those of a level 1 character. Designer’s Note : The reason for different multipliers for damage dice and ability bonuses is the fact that damage dice for powers also increase with level. Damage dice for a Level 30 power are double those of a Level 1 power, so we need a damage dice multiplier of x4 at that level in order to match the expected total multiplier of x8. 2.3.2.2 Rolling Damage Rolls - Monsters Monsters have fixed damage values rather than damage dice, so the rules for their damage rolls are much simpler. When a monster hits an enemy with an attack, the GM may choose one of the following ways to determine the amount of damage: Fixed damage: Deal the amount of attack damage indicated in the monster’s stat block. Variable damage: Roll 1d6 to modify the base attack damage. When using variable damage, roll 1d6 and calculate total damage based on the roll: 1-2: Base damage - (E) 3-4: Base damage 5-6: Base damage + (E) , where (E) is the monster’s extra damage stat, as listed in the monster stat block. Example: A goblin hits a PC with an attack that deals 8 damage. If the GM chooses to use fixed damage, the attack deals 8 damage. If they choose variable damage instead, they will roll 1d6 and use the goblin’s (E) stat value of 2 to modify the damage, for a total of 6 damage on a roll of 1-2, 8 damage on a roll of 3-4, and 10 damage on a roll of 5-6. Tip: We recommend GMs to use fixed damage for minion monsters, and variable damage for other monsters, to make combat less predictable. That said, GMs can choose fixed damage for all monsters when they want to speed up combat. 2.3.2.3 Resistances and Vulnerabilities TODO: Complete this section Summary - Resistances and vulnerabilities: Immunity: Negate damage Resistance: Reduce damage by 1/2 Partial Resistance: Reduce damage by 1/4 Partial Vulnerability: Increase damage by 1/4 Vulnerability: Increase damage by 1/2 Notes: All fractions are rounded down. Resistances can be downgraded as follows: Immunity to Resistance, Resistance to Partial Resistance, Partial Resistance to normal damage Vulnerabilities can be downgraded as follows: Vulnerability to Partial Vulnerability, Partial Vulnerability to normal damage If there are multiple resistances and vulnerabilities, pick the highest Resistance/Immunity, and the highest Vulnerability. Subtract damage from the Resistance, then add damage from the Vulnerability. TODO: - Show examples - Explain that Immunity + Vulnerability first subtracts 100% damage, then adds the amount from the Vulnerability. 2.3.2.4 Damage Types An attack can have one or more damage types. There are the following damage types in the game: Physical (default) Fire Cold Lightning Radiant Shadow Poison Psychic Damage types do not have any inherent effect, but there are many character abilities that depend on damage type, such as resistances, vulnerabilities, and damage bonuses. If no damage type is specified, the damage type is Physical. Compatibility Note: Some damage types from legacy rules are no longer supported or have been renamed: Necrotic: Renamed to Shadow Force: Use Physical instead Thunder: Use Physical instead Acid: Use Physical instead. Any legacy rules that grant resistance or vulnerability to Force, Thunder or Acid should be ignored (do not convert them into resistance/vulnerability to Physical). Powers that used to have discontinued damage types can have keywords instead: A character can have powers with the Acid keyword, and Feats or Features that affect these powers. Tip: These are the resistances (R) and vulnerabilities (V) to damage types of most common monster types: Poison - R: Construct, Undead, Dwarf; V: Fey, Plant, Swarm Radiant - R: Aberrant, Celestial, Blind; V:Undead, Shadow Psychic - R: Construct, Plant, Eladrin; V: Aberrant Shadow - R: Shadow; V: Celestial Fire - R: Fire, Devil, Tiefling; V: Plant, Cold Cold - R: Cold, V: Fire, Ooze Lightning - R: Earth, V: Construct 2.3.3 Rolling Action Point Checks Action Points are a special kind of resource that Player Characters can spend to gain additional actions in combat. Typically, Action Points are not available at the start of an encounter but, as the combat progresses, Player Characters gain a small chance of using an Action Point, which increases with each additional turn. This is resolved with an Action Point Check. To make an Action Point Check, a character rolls a d6, and adds the current value of the Escalation Die (explained in the following section), as well as any bonuses or penalties to Action Point rolls that apply for that character. If the result is 6 or higher, the attempt is successful, and the character can spend the Action Point. Otherwise, it is a failure - the character is not able to use the Action Point, and no Action Point is lost. Action Point Check= d6 + Escalation Die + Action Point Check Modifiers The following Action Point Check Modifiers can apply: Character is Bloodied: +1 In addition, some characters can have special abilities that modify Action Point Checks. As an example, Human characters have an Origin Feature that grants them +1 to Action Point Checks Each character may only attempt an Action Point Check per turn, and spend a single Action Point per encounter. The primary way to spend an action point is the Use Action Point maneuver: Use Action Point - Maneuver Utility Free Action (1/turn) - Effect: Make an Action Point Check. If successful, you can spend an Action Point to gain an extra Standard Action. (You can only spend one Action Point per encounter.) Note that, in addition to Player Characters, some special monsters such as Elite or Solo monsters are also capable of using Action Points. 2.3.4 Escalation Die For each encounter, the GM keeps track of how many turns have passed since the encounter started. At the start of the third turn, the GM takes a special d4 called the Escalation Die and sets it to 1. This value increases on each turn thereafter, as shown in the table below: Turn Escalation Die 1 0 2 0 3 1 4 2 5 3 6+ 4 The Escalation Die value is used as follows: - Add the Escalation Die to every Hit Roll (both for PCs and monsters) - Subtract the Escalation Die from every Skill Check Tip: The purpose of the Escalation Die is to ensure that combat encounters do not last too long (by making attacks more lethal as time progresses), and to give PCs a sense of urgency on skill encounters (by making checks harder with time). 2.4 Character Stats In this section, we describe the main stats that affect the performance of characters (including both Player Characters and Monsters) in the game. 2.4.1 Level The Level of a character is a general measure of that character’s relative power. Player Characters start at level 1, and gain levels as they acquire experience, up to a maximum of 30. Monsters have a level that is determined by their race, and is typically between 1 and 30, but can exceptionally go over 30. The most direct benefit of Level is its impact on character attacks and defenses - both PCs and monsters get a bonus to their Hit Rolls and defenses based on their level, which is explained in the following section. In addition, a character’s Hit Points are derived from character level (and class), and attack damage increases with level. For a detailed view of damage progression for Player Characters, see Levelling in the Character Building chapter. For a detailed view of damage progression for monsters, see Monster Stats in the Monster chapter. Based on the level of Player Characters, the game is organized in three tiers: Heroic (levels 1 to 10), Paragon (levels 11 to 20) and Epic (levels 21 and above). Character tier is sometimes referenced by game elements such as feats, but otherwise has no direct impact on the game. For a detailed discussion of tiers, see Levelling in the Character Building chapter. 2.4.2 Level Bonuses to Hit and Defenses. PCs and monsters get a bonus to their Hit Rolls and defenses based on their level, as shown in the table below: Level PC Hit Bonus PC Def Bonus Monster Hit Bonus Monster Def Bonus 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 1 3 1 1 1 1 4 1 2 1 2 5 2 2 2 2 6 2 3 2 3 7 3 3 3 3 8 3 4 3 4 9 4 4 4 4 10 4 5 4 5 11 5 5 5 5 12 5 6 5 6 13 6 6 6 6 14 6 7 6 7 15 7 7 7 7 16 7 8 7 8 17 8 8 8 8 18 8 9 8 9 19 9 9 9 9 20 9 10 9 10 21 10 10 10 10 22 10 11 10 11 23 11 11 11 11 24 11 12 11 12 25 12 12 12 12 26 12 13 12 13 27 13 13 13 13 28 13 14 13 14 29 14 14 14 14 30 15 15 15 15 Note that these bonuses are already included in a monster’s stat block - they are provided here for reference. 2.4.3 Hit Points Combat in the game is represented as a succession of attacks where characters deal a certain amount of damage to each other. Hit Points (abbreviated as HP) are a character stat that determines how much damage the character can take before falling unconscious. The amount of HP of a Character depends on character Level and Class, for Player Characters, and on character Level, monster Role, and monster Type, in the case of monsters. The HP progression for Player Characters is: Low HP Medium HP High HP Level HP Surge HP Surge HP Surge 1 22 5 27 6 33 8 2 24 6 30 7 36 9 3 26 6 32 8 39 9 4 28 7 35 8 42 10 5 30 7 37 9 45 11 6 32 8 40 10 48 12 7 34 8 42 10 51 12 8 36 9 45 11 54 13 9 38 9 47 11 57 14 10 40 10 50 12 60 15 11 44 11 55 13 66 16 12 48 12 60 15 72 18 13 52 13 65 16 78 19 14 56 14 70 17 84 21 15 60 15 75 18 90 22 16 64 16 80 20 96 24 17 68 17 85 21 102 25 18 72 18 90 22 108 27 19 76 19 95 23 114 28 20 80 20 100 25 120 30 21 88 22 110 27 132 33 22 96 24 120 30 144 36 23 104 26 130 32 156 39 24 112 28 140 35 168 42 25 120 30 150 37 180 45 26 128 32 160 40 192 48 27 136 34 170 42 204 51 28 144 36 180 45 216 54 29 152 38 190 47 228 57 30 160 40 200 50 240 60 A character under half of their maximum Hit Points is said to be Bloodied. Many game effects check for the Bloodied condition in characters. For Player Characters, another stat derived from Hit Points is the Surge Value, which determines the amount of HP that is healed when a character spends a Surge to heal. A character’s Surge Value is equal to one quarter their base Hit Points. Effects that modify a character’s maximum Hit Points do not change Surge Value. 2.4.4 Abilities All characters have six Abilities, which are used for non-combat interaction such as Skill Checks and Ability Checks, as well as for combat maneuvers. For Player Characters, Abilities are often used to determine the effect of Powers and other attacks. The abilities are: Strength (Str): Ability to exert force, perform physical feats Constitution (Con): Ability to endure pain, make long efforts, concentrate. Dexterity (Dex): Ability to move quickly and gracefully. Coordination. Wisdom (Wis): Ability to know the environment, observe and anticipate. Intuition. Charisma (Cha): Ability to communicate and persuade. Self-confidence. Intelligence (Int): Ability to reason, memorize, learn. Each Ability is a value, typically ranging between -1 and 5, which is applied as a modifier to Skill Checks, Ability Checks, and a variety of Power effects, with the exception of those dealing with damage and healing. For effects related to damage and healing of a Player Character, an Ability is adjusted by a level-dependent multiplier. This is called an Ability Damage Modifier. For Player Characters, some stats that are derived from Abilities. These are the Secondary Defenses (Fortitude, Reflex, Will) and Secondary Stats (Reaction, Surges, and Initiative). These are the stats that correspond to each Ability: Strength: Fortitude, Reaction Constitution: Fortitude, Surges Dexterity: Reflex, Initiative Wisdom: Reflex, Reaction Charisma: Will, Surges Intelligence: Will, Initiative The process for generating a Player Character’s Abilities is described in the Stat Generation section, in the Character Building chapter. 2.4.4.1 Ability Damage Modifier As the level of characters increases, so do their Hit Points, the amount of damage they deal, and the amount of healing they require. To keep Ability modifiers relevant when applied to damaging and healing effects of a Player Character, we adjust them by a multiplier that depends on the character’s level. The Ability modifier multiplied by this value is called Ability Damage Modifier. There is an Ability Damage Modifier for each character Ability, and there are referred to as Strength Damage Modifier, Dexterity Damage Modifier, and so on. The multiplier applied for an Ability Damage Modifier varies with the character’s level, from 1 at level 1 to a maximum of 8 at level 30. The progression by level is: Level Ability Multiplier 1 x1 4 x1.5 9 x2 11 x2.5 14 x3 17 x3.5 19 x4 21 x5 24 x6 27 x7 29 x8 An Ability Damage Modifier is applied instead of a regular Ability score in the following cases: Damage roll and extra damage Extra Miss Damage Damage modifier Damage penalty Shield Points (also known as Temporary Hit Points) Bonus to HP Bonus to Surge Value Healing or extra healing Regeneration Compatibility Note: Some old powers use Ability Modifiers in combination with Resistances or Vulnerabilities. This is no longer supported - to see how this is translated to the current rules, see Resistances and Vulnerabilities in the Combat chapter. 2.4.5 Defenses A character’’s defenses determine how hard the character is to hit with attacks. Characters have one Primary Defense and three Secondary Defenses. Tip: Defense values typically range between 11 and 17 for Player Characters, and between 11 and 15 for monsters. For all characters, the average defense value is 13, which corresponds to a 60% chance of being hit on an attack with the typical hit bonus of +4. Armor (Arm), is the Primary Defense, the one most commonly targeted by attacks. For Player Characters, Arm is determined by the type of Armor and Shield worn by the character, plus a class-dependent bonus if the character is wearing Light Armor. The following formula is used while wearing Light Armor: Arm = 10 + Armor bonus + Shield bonus + Class Light Armor bonus A Player Character wearing Heavy Armor uses the following Arm formula instead: Arm = 10 + Armor bonus + Shield bonus A table stating the Arm bonuses for each type of Armor and Shield is provided in the Equipment section of the Character Building chapter. A table with the Light Armor bonuses and other class stats is provided in the Class section of the Character Building chapter. For Monsters, Arm is determined by monster class. A table with the typical Arm values for each class role is provided in the Monster Stats section of the Monsters chapter. The Secondary Defenses are Fortitude (For), Reflex (Ref) and Will (Wil). These defenses are used much less frequently than Armor Class: on average, all three Secondary Defenses put together are targeted roughly as much as Arm. For Player Characters, each Secondary defense is determined by the character’s Ability scores, plus a bonus based on character class: For = 10 + Class bonus to For + (highest of Str and Con) Ref = 10 + Class bonus to Ref + (highest of Dex and Wis) Wil = 10 + Class bonus to Wil + (highest of Cha and Int) A table stating the Secondary Defense bonuses and other stats for classes is provided in the Class section of the Character Building chapter. For Monsters, Secondary Defenses are determined by monster class. A table with the typical defense values for each class role is provided in the Monster Stats section of the Monsters chapter. Tip:As a general guideline, each defense is targeted by the following types of attacks: Armor: Physical attacks, including most melee attacks, some ranged attacks, and a few close and area attacks. Fortitude: Physical, Poison, Shadow and Cold attacks, including some melee attacks, and a few ranged, close and area attacks. Reflex: Physical, Fire, Lightning, Radiant and Cold attacks, including most close and area attacks, and a few melee and ranged attacks. Will: Physical, Psychic, Radiant and Poison attacks, including some ranged attacks, and a few melee, close, and area attacks. 2.4.6 Secondary Stats In addition to their direct application as modifiers to Powers and Skill Checks, a Player Character’s Ability scores are used to generate six important stats: the three Secondary Defenses and three Secondary Stats. The Secondary Stats are Reaction Modifier, Surge Number, and Initiative Modifier. Reaction Modifier is a hit modifier that applies to a character’s Spontaneous Reaction attacks. The most common type of Spontaneous Reaction attack is the Opportunity Attack, which is triggered by moving or making Ranged or Area attacks while adjacent to an enemy. Typical values for a Reaction Modifier range between -5 and +0. For Player Characters, a Reaction Modifier is determined as follows: Reaction Modifier = (highest of Str and Wis) - 4 Surge Number is the maximum number of Surges that a Player Character can have. Characters can spend surges during an encounter to heal HP, and outside of encounters to have a Short Rest and recover all HP and Encounter powers. Characters regain all of their Surges after a Full Rest. Typical Surge Numbers range between 6 and 14. Each character class has a base value for Surge Number, which is modified by the character’s abilities: Surge Number = Character Surges + (highest of Con and Cha) Initiative Modifier is a value that is added to a character’s Initiative Roll at the start of an encounter, to determine the order in which character turns are taken. Typical values for an Initiative Modifier range between -1 and +4. Characters wearing armor may suffer an Armor Penalty, which is applied to the Initiative Modifier as well as to many Skills: Initiative Modifier = (highest of Dex and Int) - Armor Penalty Monster characters also have a Reaction Modifier and Initiative Modifier though, lacking Surges, they have no Surge Number. These stats are determined by monster class; a table with typical stat values for each class role is provided in the Monster Stats section of the Monsters chapter. For a detailed discussion of Reactions, including the use of Spontaneous Reactions and application of Reaction Modifiers, see Reactions in the Combat chapter. For more information about Surge usage and recovery, see Healing in the Combat chapter, and Resting in the Adventuring chapter. For a description of Initiative Rolls, see Combat Sequence in the Combat chapter, and for a list of the different types of armor and their associated Armor Penalty, see Equipment in the Character Building chapter. 2.4.7 Movement Speed During an encounter, characters are assigned a position in a grid map, and they can take actions to move to new positions. The base movement distance that a character can move, measured in map squares, is called Movement Speed. This stat depends on the character’s origin, and its value typically ranges between 4 and 7. Player Characters wearing Heavy Armor usually apply an Armor Movement Penalty of -1 to their Movement Speed: Movement Speed = Origin Speed - Armor Movement Penalty. A summary table with the origin Speed and other stats corresponding to each Player Character origin is provided in the Origins section of the Character Building chapter. A table with the properties of different types of Armor and Shields, including Armor Movement Penalty, is provided in the Equipment section of the Character Building chapter. Movement Speed is used for characters moving on the ground, which in the game world may translate into walking, running, crawling, oozing, rolling, or other exotic means of displacement. Some characters are capable of other forms of movement, such as flying or swimming, which have their own speed stats: Flight Speed, for creatures capable of flying. Swimming Speed, for aquatic creatures capable of swimming without a Skill check. Burrowing Speed, for moving by making tunnels in the ground or through walls. Teleport Speed, for creatures capable of teleporting between two squares within sight. Whenever a game element refers to a character’s Speed, this applies to the Speed for any type of movement the character is using at the moment. An in-depth discussion of different modes of movement is provided in the Movement section of the Combat chapter. 2.5 Powers Player Characters can gain powers from their Origin, Class, Feats and Magic Items. Monsters can also have powers. In this section, we explain how to read a power. Consider the following example power: (TODO: ADD EXAMPLE POWER) We can see the following elements in the power text block: Power type: Utility or Attack Power Name Power Level: Used in character creation for PCs Usage Frequency: At-Will, Encounter, Daily or Recharge. Keywords: Descriptive categories, like Weapon, Implement or Fire Action Type: Standard, Move, Minor, Free or Triggered Action, or Reaction Action Trigger: Some powers are only triggered on a specific condition. Range: Melee, Ranged, Close or Area Attack Roll: Describes bonus to hit, targeted defense. Effect on Hit: Describes power effects, including damage, on a successful hit roll. Effect on Miss: Describes power effects, including damage, on a failed hit roll. Effect: Describes fixed effects that happen regardless of hit roll. Sustain: Some powers can persist if the character spends additional actions on subsequent turns. Upgrade: Used in character creation for PCs: Additional effects gained when the power occupies a higher level slot. Each power element is described in detail in the following sections. 2.5.1 Power Type 2.5.2 Power Name 2.5.3 Power Level 2.5.4 Usage Frequency 2.5.5 Power Categories 2.5.6 Action Type 2.5.6.1 Action Trigger 2.5.7 Power Range 2.5.8 Power Attack Roll 2.5.9 Effect on Hit 2.5.10 Effect on Miss 2.5.11 Power Effect 2.5.12 Sustain Powers 2.5.13 Power Upgrades "],

The overall character creation process is first described, and then each creation and levelling step is discussed in detail: stat generation, Origin and class selection, mundane equipment, feat selection, levelling up, and using magic items. Overview Stat Generation Origins Classes Paragon Paths Epic Destinies Equipment Feats Levelling Magic Items 3.1 Character Creation Overview From the initial character concept to the point where the character sheet is complete, there are several decisions that a player must take in order to create a first level character. In this section, we explain the character creation process as a whole, and a more detailed discussion of each step is provided later on. The basic steps for creating a character are: Character concept and story Origin and Class selection Ability generation Skill selection Equipment selection Feat selection Power selection (Levelling) Tip: Although beginning players are encouraged to follow the character creation steps in order as listed above, it is quite possible to go back and forth between steps, as each decision provides new inspiration and ideas to improve on previous choices. Furthermore, since the number of available options may get overwhelming for inexperienced (and not so inexperienced) players, we provide pre-built sample characters that can be played as-is, or used as basic templates to be customized to taste. These sample characters, along with suggested level-up options up to level 30, can be found in the Classes chapter. 3.2 Character concept and story … 3.3 Origin … 3.4 Class selection 3.4.1 Power Source 3.4.2 Role 3.4.3 Class Build 3.4.4 Class Powers … 3.5 Ability generation Once the player has decided on a character class and a class build, the Abilities for the Player Character can be generated. To do this, the player selects a Primary and a Secondary ability, and then assigns scores to each. These choices are usually conditioned, if not fully determined, by the character’s class build: The Primary Ability is the character’s strongest and most important Ability, used for most attacks. Most class builds have a fixed Primary Ability. The Secondary Ability adds useful bonuses to several character Powers and Class Features. Many class builds have a predetermined Secondary Ability, though some provide a choice between two or three options. Assign the following scores: +4 to Primary Ability +3 to Secondary Ability +0 to to other Abilities Compatibility Note: Under legacy rules, PCs used to get Ability increases from their Origin (then called Race), as well as from levelling up. This is no longer the case, but see the Ability Skill Bonus section below. Compatibility Note: The only remaining way to increase Ability Scores is through Epic Destinies. However, whenever an Epic Destiny from an older rulebook provides a bonus to an Ability score, that bonus is halved (typically from +2 to +1). 3.5.1 Wide Ability Array (Advanced rule) The set of Ability scores described above is known as the Default Ability Array, and should be a good fit for the majority of characters. However, some character builds may have ability requirements that are spread across many abilities, usually due to heavy multiclassing or to being non-conventional designs from early legacy sourcebooks. For those cases, and with approval of the GM, a player may choose instead the Wide Ability Array - choose one Primary Ability and two Secondary Abilities (instead of just one, as usual), and assign the following scores: +3 to Primary Ability +3 to Secondary Ability +0 to to other Abilities Tip: We recommend new players to ignore the Wide Ability Array. Even experienced players should stay away from this most of the time - it’s just offered as a patch from some old classes that would otherwise be very difficult to play. 3.5.2 Tertiary Ability and Weak Ability (Optional) As an option, players can choose two Abilities that are not Primary nor Secondary to be their Tertiary and Weak Abilities: The Tertiary Ability is an Ability with a slightly above average score. The Weak Ability is an Ability that sees little to no use for the character, and has the lowest score. Class builds should provide suggestions for suitable Weak Abilities, but the choice is otherwise up to the player. Assign the following scores: +1 to Tertiary Ability -1 to Weak Ability Tip: Having a Tertiary and Weak abilities very slightly increases a PC’s effectiveness, but it’s not really a required step in character generation. New players are encouraged to skip this step until they have a good grasp of the rules of the game and the impact of changing these ability scores. We recommend GMs to allow selection of Tertiary and Weak abilities at a later point in the game, such as after reaching Level 2. 3.6 Skill Bonuses There are 12 Skills in the game that determine how good a character is at different activities. For each skill, the associated Skill Bonus is generated as follows: Skill Bonus = Ability Skill Bonus + Skill Training Bonus + Armor Penalty + Other Modifiers Each of these modifiers is explained in a separate section below. The following table shows all 12 Skills with their corresponding Abilities and a summary of what they are used for. For a detailed description of Skills and how they work, see the Skills chapter. Skill Ability Summary Athletics Strength Sprinting, Climbing, Swimming Authority Strength Intimidation, Leadership, Military Concentration Constitution Study, Craftsmanship, Art Endurance Constitution Stamina, Wakefulness, Survival Finesse Dexterity Balance, Tumbling, Lockpicking Stealth Dexterity Hiding, Secrets, Ciphers Perception Wisdom Observation, Empathy, Memory Nature Wisdom Flora, Fauna, Environment, Healing Diplomacy Charisma Rethoric, Etiquette, Politics Trickery Charisma Lying, Gossip, Forgery Arcana Intelligence Magic, Science, Cosmology Lore Intelligence History, Geography, Law 3.6.1 Ability Skill Bonus Each Skill has an associated Ability, which is used to determine the Skill Bonus. However, rather than directly adding ability scores to the Skill Bonus, we use a related value, called the Ability Skill Bonus. Unlike Ability scores, which remain constant after a character creation, an Ability Skill Bonus can be affected by the character’s Origin, and increase as they level up. For each Ability, the corresponding Ability Skill Bonus is generated as follows: Ability Skill Bonus = Ability + Origin Ability Modifier + Ability Skill Points + Other Modifiers An explanation for each : - Ability: Ability Score - Origin Ability Modifier: Modifier to that Ability Skill Bonus from the character’s Origin. Typically, Origins add +1 to 2 fixed Ability Skill Bonuses - Ability Skill Points: Players get to assign extra points to add to their Ability Skill Bonus as they level up - see the table below. - Other Modifiers: Characters can gain additional modifiers from Feats or Magic Items, among other sources. Ability Skill Points are gained at levels 4, 8, 14, 18, 24 and 28. When a PC reaches one of these levels, they choose an Ability and add 1 to the Ability Skill Points assigned to that Ability Skill Bonus, as shown in the table below: Level | Points gained | Score Limit 4 | +1 | +2 8 | +1 | +3 14 | +1 | +3 18 | +1 | +4 24 | +1 | +4 28 | +1 | +5 Players are restricted in the abilities they can choose to increase their Ability Skill Points: only abilities where the sum of Ability Score and current Ability Skill Points are below a certain value (shown in column Score Limit of the table above) can be chosen this way. Other bonuses, such as the Origin Ability Modifier, are not counted towards the Score Limit. Example - Ability Skill Bonus for a Level 1 PC. Gimli is a Level 1 Dwarf Warrior with +4 Str, +3 Con, and +0 to other abilities. Origin Ability Modifiers for a Dwarf are +1 Con, +1 Wis. This character will have the following Ability Skill Bonuses: Str: +4 (Ability) Con: +3 (Ability) +1 (Origin) ; Total: +4 Dex: +0 (Ability) Wis: +0 (Ability) +1 (Origin) ; Total: +1 Int: +0 (Ability) Cha: +0 (Ability) Example - Ability Skill Points. The character from the previous example levels up. When he reaches level 4, he can gain an Ability Skill Point on any ability other than Str and Con. He chooses to add a point to Wis. Ability Skill Bonus for Wis at Level 4: Wis: +0 (Ability) +1 (Origin) +1 (Points); Total: +2 At level 8, he can add an Ability Skill point on any ability other than Str. He chooses Con this time. Ability Skill Bonus for Con at Level 8: Con: +3 (Ability) +1 (Origin) +1 (Points); Total: +5 3.6.2 Skill Training Depending on their class, Player Characters can choose a number of Skills to become Trained in them. Characters gain a +3 bonus to Skill Checks with Trained Skills, and Skill Checks of Hard Difficulty are only available to characters with training in that Skill. In order to select a Player Character’s Skills, the player should look look at the Class Skill List for the character’s class, as well as the Racial Skill List for the character’s Origin. Any Skill in either of these lists can be selected as a Trained Skill for the character. The player then looks at the number of Trained Skills allowed by the character’s class, and selects that many Trained Skills. Compatibility Note: The Racial Skill rule replaces racial Skill bonuses from older rulebooks. When a Origin provides a numeric bonus to one or more Skills, consider instead that these Skills are Racial Skills. Any other Skill-related benefit, such as gaining Training with a specific Skill, remains unchanged. Some Origins and Classes provide automatic training with predetermined Skills. In that case, the character first gains training with these skills, and then the player selects Trained Skills as usual. Tip: When selecting Trained Skills, it is usually a good idea to prioritize Skills that match the character’s Primary or Secondary Abilities. If you end up with training in two or more Skills associated with your Tertiary or Weak Abilities, consider taking Unnatural Ability as an Adventure Feat when you level up, in order to compensate for the lower Ability scores in these Skills. Tip: As your character levels up, you can expand your Trained Skill selection by taking Skill Training as an Adventure Feat. Alternatively, you can specialize on your best Skills by taking Skill Focus as an Adventure Feat. 3.6.3 Armor Penalty to Skill Some types of armor have an Armor Penalty value (typically -1). This penalty applies to Skill Checks for Athletics, Endurance, Finesse, and Stealth. See Armor in the equipment section of this chapter for more information. 3.6.4 Other Skill Bonuses Characters can gain additional modifiers from Feats or Magic Items, among other sources. 3.7 Equipment selection A character’s class determines which weapons, implements and armor the character is proficient with. Upon creation, every character starts the game with the following items: Up to three weapons the character is proficient with. An armor the character is proficient with. Up to one implement the character is proficient with. In addition, starting characters get mundane equipment that has no impact on their stats and powers, including clothing, adventuring supplies, food, and money. The specific details should vary based on the character’s background and the context of the initial adventure, and be the result of a dialogue between player and Game Master. We suggest, by default, providing characters with food for a week of travel, money to cover living for a month, and a non-exhaustive list of items to carry with them, such as bedrolls, rope, and torches. In addition, whenever a more unusual item of reasonable weight and cost is needed, we recommend the Game Master to assume that a character is carrying it, provided that the player can come up with a convincing explanation. Designer Note: Some games aim to provide a detailed simulation of economy in a fantasy world. This is not such a game. We believe that keeping track of the specific contents of a player’s backpack or the balance of each economic transaction are not critical to the game experience. Instead, we recommend players and Game Masters to keep inventories vague and flexible, outside of player rewards like Magic Items, or items of special importance to the game plot. That said, if you favor more detailed rules for economy, there are tables with recommended item costs and weights from other game systems, such as D20SRD (http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/equipment.htm ) and 13AGESRD (http://www.13thagesrd.com/equipment ), which are freely available online. You can use these tables as a reference for setting item prices in your campaign. In the rest of this section, we list the weapons, armor and implement available in the game, along with a description of their rules. 3.7.1 Weapons Each weapon in the game is described by the following elements: Name Family: A category of weapons with similar properties. For example, Axes is a weapon family that includes hand axes, battle axes, and greataxes. Damage: Base damage dealt per weapon damage die. Keywords: Special properties associated with the weapon. Training: How much training is required to wield the weapon, determines which classes can use it. Type: Whether it is a Melee or Ranged weapon. Hands:Whether the weapon requires 1 or 2 hands to be wielded. A character’s class determines which weapons the character is trained to use. A character using a weapon without training does not benefit from any of the weapon’s properties, including damage, keywords, and any magic abilities. Instead, the weapon is treated as an Light Improvised Weapon if it requires one hand to wield, or a Heavy Improvised Weapon if it requires two hands. Improvised weapons can be used without training. Compatibility Note: In older rulebooks, weapon training is referred to as weapon proficiency, and weapons can have a Proficiency Bonus to hit, if the character is trained with them. This Proficiency Bonus no longer exists, and any mentions to it should be ignored. 3.7.1.1 Weapon Families The following weapon families are supported in the game: Axe: Melee weapon consisting of a heavy edged head and a handle. Bow: Ranged weapon consisting of a strip of wood or other flexible material and a string, used to shoot arrows. Crossbow: Ranged weapon consisting on a bow mounted on a stick and a mechanism to hold the string. Used to shoot bolts. Flail: Melee weapon consisting on a blunt or spiked head attached to a handle by a chain or rope. Hammer: Melee weapon consisting of a heavy blunt head and a handle. Heavy Blade: Melee weapon with a long and heavy blade Improvised: A common object used as a weapon, or a weapon used without training. Light Blade: Melee weapon with a short or slender blade Sling: Ranged weapon consisting of a pouch and a string, used to throw stones or bullets. Spear: Melee weapon consisting of a pointed head attached to a long shaft. Staff: Melee weapon consisting of a long wooden shaft. Unarmed: A character’s own body used as a melee weapon. Tip: Weapon Family is of special relevance in relation to the Weapon Focus category of Feats, as these Feats often give bonuses when wielding any weapon of a specific family. Advanced players are encouraged to study the different Feat bonuses when considering their weapon of choice. For beginning players, we suggest instead to choose based on aesthetic preferences - you can always use the Retraining rule to rethink your choice at a later point. 3.7.1.2 Weapon Keywords The following weapon keywords are supported in the game: Off-Hand: The weapon can be wielded in the off-hand while another weapon or object is wielded in the main hand. Parry: A character wielding one or more weapons or shields with Parry gains +1 to Arm against Melee and Close attacks. The bonus from multiple instances of this keyword does not stack. Ranged: Ranged weapons have the Range keyword, followed by a number indicating the Weapon Range. Characters can make Ranged and Area attacks up to a distance equal to the Weapon Range without penalty. In addition, characters can make Ranged (but not Area) attacks at long range, to distances between Weapon Range and twice the Weapon Range, with a -2 penalty to hit. Reach: Weapons with reach increase the Melee Reach for attacks made with them by a certain amount. A medium-sized character typically has a Melee Reach of 1, which increases to 2 with a Reach +1 weapon, and to 3 with a Reach +2 weapon. Throw: Melee weapons with Throw can be used to make Ranged and Area attacks as well as Melee and Close attacks. The Throw keyword is followed by a number indicating the Weapon Range. Characters can make Ranged and Area attacks up to a distance equal to the Weapon Range without penalty. In addition, characters can make Ranged (but not Area) attacks at long range, to distances between Weapon Range and twice the Weapon Range, with a -2 penalty to hit. After using a Ranged or Area attack power with a Throw weapon, choose a character targeted by the attack. The weapon is placed on the ground in a square in the character’s space. Magical Weapons with Throw are automatically returned to the wielder’s hand after each attack instead. Unwieldy: Attacks made with this weapon gain a -1 penalty to hit. Versatile: When wielded on the main hand with a free off-hand, this weapon deals +1 damage per weapon damage die. This increases to +2 damage per weapon damage die at level 16. Very Unwieldy: Attacks made with this weapon gain a -2 penalty to hit. Compatibility Note In older rulebooks, Throw weapons can be classified as Heavy Thrown or Light Thrown. Treat any mention to either of these as referring to Throw weapons instead. 3.7.1.3 Weapon Hands The hand requirements to use a weapon are as follows: One-handed weapons without the Off-Hand keyword can be wielded in the character’s main hand. The character can wield another item, such as an Off-Hand weapon, an implement or a Shield, in the Off-Hand. One-handed weapons with the Off-Hand keyword can be wielded in the character’s main hand or off-hand. The character can wield another item, such as an Off-Hand weapon, an implement or a Shield, in the other hand. When making an attack, a character can choose to use either the main hand weapon or the Off-Hand weapon - there are no penalties for Off-Hand attacks. Two-handed weapons require both hands to be wielded. A character cannot use a hand to wield any other item while wielding such a weapon. One-handed versatility : A character wielding a One-Handed weapon while leaving the other hand free can choose to take a -1 Hit penalty on an attack with that weapon to gain a +1 bonus to the weapon damage (scaling with Weapon Damage Multiplier). When they do, that weapon counts as Two-Handed for the purpose of powers or abilities that care about weapon types. Tip: It is usually better to use two-handed weapons, or One-handed weapons with a free hand or a Light Shield, if you want your character to focus on the offense, and a one-handed weapon with a Heavy Shield if you prefer focusing on defense. Wielding a weapon in each hand offers you extra flexibility, but otherwise it does not grant additional attacks or any other inherent benefits, so it is usually not a good idea, unless you have class Powers or Features that require dual wielding or otherwise reward you for it. 3.7.1.4 Weapon Tables The tables below provide stats for all weapons in the game, classified by the type of training they require, whether they are melee or ranged weapons, and the number of hands they require. 3.7.1.4.1 Basic Weapons Name Family Hit Damage Keywords Type Hands Dagger Light Blade 0 1d4 Off-hand, Throw 5 Melee 1 hand Hand Axe Axe 0 1d4 Off-hand, Throw 5 Melee 1 hand Light Hammer Hammer 0 1d4 Off-hand, Throw 5 Melee 1 hand Javelin Spear 0 1d4 Off-hand, Throw 5 Melee 1 hand Mace Hammer -1 1d8 Melee 2 hands Halfspear Spear -1 1d8 Melee 2 hands Scythe Heavy Blade -1 1d8 Melee 2 hands Quarterstaff Staff -1 1d8 Melee 2 hands 3.7.1.4.2 Improvised Weapons Name Family Hit Damage Keywords Type Hands Unarmed Unarmed -2 1d4 Melee 1 hand Improvised, Light Improvised -1 1d4 Throw 5 Melee 1 hand Improvised, Heavy Improvised -2 1d8 Throw 2 Melee 2 hands 3.7.1.4.3 Martial Weapons Name Family Hit Damage Keywords Type Hands Short Sword Light Blade 1 1d4 Off-hand Melee 1 hand Nunchaku Flail 1 1d4 Off-hand Melee 1 hand Longsword Heavy Blade 0 1d8 Melee 1 hand Rapier Light Blade 0 1d8 Melee 1 hand Battle Axe Axe 0 1d8 Melee 1 hand Warhammer Hammer 0 1d8 Melee 1 hand Light Flail Flail 0 1d8 Melee 1 hand Greatsword Heavy Blade -1 1d12 Melee 2 hands Greataxe Axe -1 1d12 Melee 2 hands Maul Hammer -1 1d12 Melee 2 hands Heavy Flail Flail -1 1d12 Melee 2 hands Longspear Spear 0 1d8 Reach 2 Melee 2 hands Glaive Heavy Blade 0 1d8 Reach 2 Melee 2 hands Halberd Axe 0 1d8 Reach 2 Melee 2 hands Whip Flail 0 1d8 Reach 2 Melee 2 hands Shuriken Light Blade 1 1d4 Off-hand, Throw 7 Ranged 1 hand Dart Light Blade 1 1d4 Off-hand, Throw 7 Ranged 1 hand Boomerang Hammer 1 1d4 Off-hand, Throw 7 Ranged 1 hand Hand Crossbow Crossbow 1 1d4 Off-hand, Ranged 7 Ranged 1 hand Sling Sling 1 1d4 Off-hand, Ranged 7 Ranged 1 hand Short Bow Bow 1 1d4 Ranged 8 Ranged 2 hands Light Crossbow Crossbow 0 1d8 Ranged 15 Ranged 2 hands Longbow Bow 0 1d8 Ranged 15 Ranged 2 hands Heavy Crossbow Crossbow -1 1d12 Ranged 10 Ranged 2 hands Composite Bow Bow -1 1d12 Ranged 10 Ranged 2 hands 3.7.1.4.4 Inner Weapons Name Family Hit Damage Keywords Type Hands Unarmed Smash Unarmed, Hammer 0 1d8 Melee 1 hand Unarmed Chop Unarmed, Axe 0 1d8 Melee 1 hand Some character classes use unique weapons not available to other classes. In these cases, stats for these weapons should be provided within the class rules. Compatibility Note: Some weapon types from older rulebooks are no longer supported. As a general rule, we recommend treating any such weapon as a currently supported weapon of the same Family, Training, Type, and Hand requirements, if available. Some cases of particular interest are: Two previously existing weapon families, Picks and Maces, have been discontinued. We recommend replacing Picks with Axes of similar properties, and replacing Maces with Hammers of similar properties. Some weapons used to have the same name as their weapon family. To remove this ambiguity, they have been renamed: Spear is now Halfspear Crossbow is now Light Crossbow Flail is now Light Flail Some character classes from older sourcebooks have bonuses associated with obsoleted weapon types. We recommend the following replacements for these weapons: Sickle: replace with Dagger Scimitar: replace with Short Sword Club: replace with Mace 3.7.2 Armor Each armor in the game is described by the following elements: Name Arm bonus: Bonus granted to a character’s Arm for wearing the armor with training. Type: Whether the armor is Light Armor or Heavy Armor, or a Shield. Armor Penalty: Penalty granted to Ranged and Area attacks and many Skills. Movement Penalty: Penalty granted to a character’s Speed (for all available movement types). Each character can wear one suit of Light Armor or Heavy Armor. In addition, each character can use one Shield. Characters wearing nothing but plainclothes, or wearing no clothes, are considered as wearing Cloth Armor. Using a shield takes up one hand, and characters cannot wield weapons or implements nor carry objects with their shield hand. Armor Penalty: Some types of armor have an Armor Penalty value (typically -1). This penalty applies to Hit rolls of Ranged and Area attacks, as well as Skill Checks for Athletics, Endurance, Finesse, and Stealth. Tip: Characters focused on Ranged and Area attacks should consider carefully whether the added protection of Heavy Armor is worth taking the Armor Penalty to hit. As a rule of thumb, a +1 to Hit on all attacks is worth more than a +1 to defend against half of enemy attacks (since armor does not protect against attacks targeting Fortitude, Reflex or Will). A character’s class determines which armors the character is trained to use. A character using an armor without training does not benefit from any of the armor’s properties, including Arm bonus and any magic abilities. However, any Armor Penalty or Movement Penalty imposed by the armor still applies. All characters are considered to be trained in the use of Cloth Armor. A character using a Shield and wearing Light Armor or Heavy Armor can add the Arm bonuses from shield and armor. Some character classes gain an additional bonus to Arm while wearing Light Armor. This is called Light Armor Arm Bonus. Some classes also have class features that grant a bonus to Arm, and these can stack with their Light Armor Arm Bonus. A table summarizing Light Armor Arm Bonus and other stats for all classes currently in the game (including classes from older rulebooks) is provided in this chapter, in the Origin and Class Selection section. To summarize, a character’s Arm is calculated as follows: Arm= 10 + Armor bonus + Shield bonus + Class Light Armor bonus Note that these are the most common types of Arm bonus, but other bonuses granted by specific Class Features, Feats, or Powers can still apply. Compatibility Note: Unlike other defenses, a character’s Abilities provide no bonus to that character’s Arm. In older rulebooks this was not the case, and it was common to have character classes whose Class Features allowed using an Ability as a bonus to Arm while wearing Light Armor. Ignore these bonuses, and any other mention of an Ability bonus to Arm. Fixed bonuses to Arm that do not depend on a character’s Abilities still apply as normal. 3.7.2.1 Armor Types The different types of armor available in the game are described as follows: Light Armor Cloth: Regular clothing, or Robes Leather: A combination of regular clothing and leather pieces for added protection, such as a leather jacket or coat, a leather suit, or leather breastplates. Heavy Armor Hide: A combination of regular clothing, leather pieces, and thick pieces of beast skin for added protection. Chain: Armor made of interlocking metal rings. Scale: Armor made of small, overlapping metal scales. Plate: Armor made of large metal plates. Shield Light Shield: Shield of reduced size and weight. Heavy Shield: Large shield that covers most of a character’s body. 3.7.2.2 Armor Table The table below provides stats for all types of armor in the game: Name Arm bonus Type Armor Penalty Movement Penalty Cloth 1 Light Armor 0 0 Leather 2 Light Armor 0 0 Hide 3 Heavy Armor -1 -1 Chain 3 Heavy Armor -1 -1 Scale 4 Heavy Armor -1 -1 Plate 5 Heavy Armor -1 -1 Shields have the following rules: Light Shield: Gain Parry (+1 Arm vs Melee and Close attacks) Heavy Shield: -1 Hit on all attacks. Gain +2 Arm. 3.7.3 Implements Each implement in the game is described by the following elements: Name Hands: Whether the implement requires a hand, two hands, or no hands at all to wield. Keywords: Special properties associated with the implement. Range: base range for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks made with the implement. Note that, unlike weapons, implements do not have an associated damage die. Damage in implement attacks is not affected by the choice of implement. The only mechanical differences between implements are their hand requirements, the bonuses provided by their associated Implement Focus Feats, and the range for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks (but not for other ranged attacks). The rules for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks are in the Stat Generation section of this chapter. A character’s class determines which implements the character is trained to use. A character wielding no implement, or wielding an implement without training uses the “No Implement” stats, which include a -2 penalty to hit due to the Very Unwieldy property. A character using an implement without training does not benefit from any of the implement’s properties, including damage, keywords, and any magic abilities. 3.7.3.1 Implement Types The following implement types are supported in the game: Staff - Long shaft, usually made of wood. Wand - Short, slender stick. Rod - Long, decorated stick. Orb - Sphere made of a transparent or reflective material Tome - Heavy leather-bound book with inscribed spells Symbol - Amulet or necklace bearing the symbol of a deity Focus - Small carried object used to channel inner energy Totem - Carved figure representing an animal, plant, or spirit. Weapon Implement - Weapon that can be used to channel supernatural powers. Some character classes allow specific types of weapons to be used as Weapon Implements. Weapon Implements require the same number of hands to wield as their associated weapons. No Implement - A character using just hand gestures to channel power. 3.7.3.2 Implement Keyword The following implement keywords are supported in the game: Very Unwieldy: Attacks made with this implement gain a -2 penalty to hit. 3.7.3.3 Implement Hands The hand requirements to use a weapon are as follows: No Hand implements do not require any free hands to be wielded. One-handed implements can be wielded in the character’s main hand or off-hand. Two-handed implements require both hands to be wielded. A character cannot use a hand to wield any other item while wielding such an implement. 3.7.3.4 Implement Table The table below provide stats for all implements in the game: Name Hands Range Keywords Staff 2 hands 12 Wand 1 hand 10 Rod 1 hand 10 Orb 1 hand 10 Tome 1 hand 10 Holy Symbol No hand 5 Ki Focus No hand 5 Totem 1 hand 10 Weapon Implement As weapon 5 No Implement 1 hand 5 Very Unwieldy 3.8 Feats A Feat is a character customization option that lets player specialize their characters beyond their Origin, Class, and Power selection. There are two main categories of feats: Combat Feats: Feats that improve a character’s combat abilities. Adventure Feats: Feats that improve a character’s abilities out of combat. Player Characters start the game with one Combat Feat and no Adventure Feats, and acquire more as they level up, up to a maximum of nine of each at level 30. Bonus feats can also be gained from other sources, such as a character’s Origin or Class. Each Feat is composed of the following elements: Name Type: Combat or Adventure. Level: The minimum level at which the Feat can be acquired. Also, the minimum level of the Feat Slot that can be used to learn the Feat. Category: A group of Feats that perform a similar function. A character can only select a single Feat from each Feat Category, unless the feats are Unrestricted. Keywords: A series of labels that describe the Feat. Feat Keywords are purely descriptive and have no associated rules, but are sometimes referenced by other Feats. Requirements: A series of conditions that a character must meet before taking the Feat. Description: The benefits granted by the feat. Summary: An abbreviated version of the Feat Description, used in summary tables. The Summary text does not necessarily provide exact or complete rules, and should only be used as a quick guide for character building decisions, not as a rules reference. Feats can have the following special properties: - Unrestricted: A character can take multiple Unrestricted feats within the same category. - Repeatable: A Feat with this property can be taken multiple times. (This also ignores the one feat per category limit). The following table summarizes the acquisition of feat slots per character level: Level Slots aquired Total Combat Feats Total Adv.

Likewise, each Adventure Feat slot can be used to gain an Adventure Feat with a level equal or lower to that of the Adventure Feat Slot. Note that Combat Feats and Adventure Feats are not interchangeable: a Combat Feat Slot cannot be used to gain Adventure Feats, nor can an Adventure Feat slot be used to gain Combat Feats. Tip: Although the power level of Feats tends to grow with their level, the differences are sometimes very small. Often, a lower level Feat will be just as effective for a given character as the higher level alternatives, if not the best option altogether. Tip: At some levels, a Feat Slot can only be filled with lower level Feats. Tip: If you are lost, or want to experiment, choosing legal Feats at random is still expected to yield competent (if unfocused) characters. Compatibility Note: Feats from legacy rulebooks are considered obsolete and should not be used. This is not, strictly speaking, due to compatibility issues (since the Feats should mostly work under the current rules), but as a way to improve the game experience - see the Designer’s Note below for a detailed explanation. That said, Game Masters who wish to incorporate older Feats into their campaigns can do so with minimal translation effort, as long as they are aware that they risk breaking design assumptions about combat length and difficulty, and class balance. Designer Note: Experienced players may find this Feat system too restrictive compared to those of previous games. However, these restrictions serve an important purpose. Here is the reasoning behind them: Separation between combat options and adventuring options: Allowing characters to freely choose between combat and non-combat Feats results in excessive performance variability, to the point that it’s virtually impossible to design high level content that will be moderately difficult and enjoyable to both characters that are completely specialized on combat and characters that only select non-combat Feats. Furthermore, it is usually optimal to ignore either combat or non-combat options (depending on the campaign), resulting in roughly half the Feats in the game seeing little to no play. The split between Combat and Adventure Feats allows us to get much more predictable character outcomes, which make for a better high level game experience. This also allows players to improve both their combat and non-combat capabilities without feeling that they are hurting their character’s potential. Feat categories: It is a natural thing for players to experiment with spending all of their customization resources in improving a single dimension of their character, such as damage, or defenses, or even mobility. Again, this leads to excessive variability between high level character builds and, as a consequence, high variability in game difficulty, combat length, and overall game experience. By classifying Feats into functional Categories, and restricting players to one Feat per Category, we can, for example, provide dozens of options to increase attack damage while ensuring that a given character will only be able to have two or three of them at once. No support for previous Feats: We wanted every Feat in the game to have a purpose, and to be playable for a significant percentage of character builds. However, legacy rulebooks had thousands of Feats with wildly inconsistent quality and power level. We decided that starting from scratch and having a compact set of Feats that could realistically be tested and polished was the best option. No class/Origin requirements: We wanted the total number of feats to be manageable for players, but also to maintain backwards compatibility with previous Origins and Classes. Since legacy rulebooks have dozens of Origins and Classes, and including Feats for only a subset of them would be considered unfair and introduce balance issues, we chose to remove racial feats altogether and replace Class Feats with options based on Class Role and Power Source, which fill a similar niche with much less effort and complexity. That said, we might reconsider this for future supplements. 3.9 Power selection 3.10 Stat generation 3.11 Levelling 3.12 Magic Items "],
["adventuring.html", "Chapter 4 Adventuring 4.1 Resource management 4.2 Resting 4.3 Resources and Resting Summary 4.4 Dying", " Chapter 4 Adventuring As players characters go on adventures, they will face a series of challenges that test them and drain their resources. There are two main types of encounters in the game: Skill encounters: The PCs interact with the environment and other characters to solve a problem. This is primarily handled by the Skill system. Combat encounters: The PCs fight monsters for survival or to achieve a goal. This is primarily handled by the Combat system. In addition, it is possible to have mixed encounters where both character Skills and Combat abilities are in the spotlight. We call these mixed encounters. Note that characters still get to use their Skills in regular Combat encounters if they choose to - the difference in mixed encounters is that there are explicit goals that require the use of Skills. A typical encounter has the following consequences: Resource use: Characters have a stat called Stamina that determines how many encounters they can take before stopping to take a Long Rest. Stamina can be lost in an encounter by receiving wounds, failing Skill Checks or using certain special powers. In addition,taking a Short Rest to recover after an encounter also spends 1 Stamina point. Rewards: Characters can gain experience points, gold, and treasure after an encounter. Campaign consequences: Depending on the degree of success of an encounter, there can be consequences for the Player Characters, their allies, or the environment. In addition, a particularly disastrous encounter can have Player Characters end up permanently crippled or even dead. 4.1 Resource management Player characters have two types of resources: per-encounter resources that are usually replenished after each challenge, and campaign resources that are recovered at a slower pace. Encounter resources are: Hit Points. How much damage the character can take before falling unconscious. Vitality. A stat that is spent to use healing powers, and is lost when knocked unconscious. Morale. How much the character can use skills this encounter. Characters lose Morale whenever they fail a Skill Check. Encounter powers. Strong powers that, once spent, are recovered with a Short Rest. Campaign resources are: Stamina. A measure of how many more encounters the character can have this day. Stamina is used to take Short Rests, and may be lost when out of encounter resources. Daily powers. Very strong powers that, once spent, are only recovered on a Full Rest or, occasionally, after achieving a milestone. Action Points. Points that can be spent to gain extra actions in an encounter. Gained after each milestone. Other player stats that are related to encounter and campaign resources are: Healing Surge: How many Hit Points the character recovers when healing. Many powers refer to using a Healing Surge - this means spending 1 Vitality to recover HP equal to their Healing Surge value. In addition, whenever a character below 1 HP is healed back above 0 HP, if this would leave them at a HP value lower than their Healing Surge, their HP becomes equal to their Healing Surge value instead. Exhaustion: A stat tracking a negative condition related to running out of Stamina. Characters gain -1 to attack rolls and skill checks for each point of Exhaustion. Exhaustion is gained by losing Stamina while at 0 Stamina, and is removed by recovering Stamina. At the GM’s discretion, a character with 5 or more Exhaustion may become incapacitated until rested. The different types of resources are inter-related. Generally speaking, taking wounds or skill failures while out of encounter resources will result in loss of Stamina. These are the consequences for running out of each type of resource: Hit Points. A character reduced below 1 HP falls Unconscious until healed back to 1 or more HP, and is Bleeding until healed for any amount. The first time a PC drops to 0 HP in an encounter, they lose 1 Vitality. In addition, a Bleeding character must make a Vitality Saving Throw at the end of each of their turns: on a failure, they lose 1 Vitality. If the save is successful, they can take a Saving Throw to become stabilised and stop being Bleeding. If a stabilised character below 1 HP takes damage, they become Bleeding again. Vitality. A character reduced to 0 Vitality loses 1 Stamina whenever they would lose or spend a Vitality point. Morale. A character reduced to 0 Morale must make a Morale Saving Throw whenever they would lose or spend a Morale point: on a failure, they lose 1 Stamina. In addition, characters with 0 Morale gain a -2 penalty to Skill Checks. Stamina and Exhaustion. A character reduced to 0 Stamina gains 1 Exhaustion whenever they would lose or spend a Stamina point. A character with Exhaustion that recovers Stamina loses 1 Exhaustion for each point of Stamina recovered. Note that characters suffer no negative consequences for running out of Encounter Powers, Daily Powers or Action Points. Players should try to use these resources carefully to avoid running out of HP and make their Stamina last as long as possible. Sidebar: Stat Values A typical character has Stamina 6, Vitality 1, and Morale 2. Stamina, Vitality and Morale are based on a character’s class. Healing Surge Value is equal to a quarter of a character’s base Hit Points, plus their Constitution / Charisma modifier. 4.2 Resting Player Characters can rest to recover resources. There are three types of rest, depending on the time and conditions of resting. In addition, some resources can also be recovered upon completing campaign objectives: Short Rest. A quick stop to catch a breath after a challenge. A character spends a Stamina point to regain all Encounter resources. Long Rest. Camping to sleep for the night during an adventure. The character regains all Encounter resources and a Stamina point. Full Rest. Proper rest at a safe location after completing a major objective. The character regains all Encounter and Campaign resources. Milestone. Morale boost after completing a partial objective (e.g. 2 challenges). The character gains an Action point and gets a chance to recover Daily Powers. Short Rests are available whenever characters are not in immediate danger. Long Rests require characters to find a relatively safe location where they can camp for at least 8 hours. Usually, characters won’t be able to take more than one Long Rest every 24 hours. Full Rests have the same requirements as Long Rests, plus they can only be taken at specific points during a campaign, at the GM’s discretion. Usually, characters will only be able to take a Full Rest after completing around 6 encounters. Milestones are usually achieved after completing 2 regular encounters, though at the GM’s discretion some encounters may count as multiple regular encounters or a fraction of an encounter, depending on their difficulty. After each milestone, Daily Powers can be recovered as follows: - For each spent Daily Power, the character rolls a D6: On a 6+, the power is recovered. - If the character has no spent Daily Powers and are below their maximum Stamina, they may instead roll a D6: On a 6+, they recover 1 Stamina. 4.3 Resources and Resting Summary The following table summarizes how resources are spent and recovered: Hit Points: Recover all HP when taking a Short Rest, Long Rest or Full Rest. Recover HP equal to your Healing Surge value whenever you use a Healing Surge. Whenever you take damage, lose that many HP. You are Unconscious while below 1 HP. When knocked below 1 HP, you are Bleeding until stabilised. While Bleeding, if you pass a Vitality Saving Throw, you can make a Saving Throw to stabilize and stop being Bleeding. When you take damage while below 1 HP and stabilised, you become Bleeding. When healing from below 1 HP to an amount between 1 HP and your Healing Surge value, your HP becomes your Healing Surge value instead. Vitality: Recover all Vitality when taking a Short Rest, Long Rest or Full Rest. Lose 1 Vitality when dropping below 1 HP for the first time in an encounter. Lose 1 Vitality when failing a Vitality Saving Throw. You make a Vitality Saving Throw at the end of your turn while Bleeding. Lose 1 Vitality when you use a healing surge. If at any point a character would spend or lose Vitality but has no Vitality left, they lose 1 Stamina instead. Morale: Recover all Morale when taking a Short Rest, Long Rest or Full Rest. Characters with 0 Morale gain a -2 penalty to Skill Checks Lose 1 Morale when failing a Skill Check. Spend 1 or more Morale when performing a Ritual. Some types of Skill Check have an additional Morale cost. See skill description for more details. If at any point a character would spend or lose Morale but has no Morale left, they take a Morale Saving Throw for each point of Morale lost. For each failure, they lose 1 Stamina. Stamina: Spend 1 Stamina to take a Short Rest Lose 1 Stamina when losing 1 Vitality while out of Vitality Lose 1 Stamina failing a Morale Saving Throw. Recover 1 Stamina when taking a Long Rest. Recover all Stamina when taking a Full Rest. Exhaustion: Gain 1 Exhaustion when losing 1 Stamina while out of Stamina. Lose 1 Exhaustion for each point of Stamina you recover. 4.4 Dying The rules for when a character should die are left intentionally vague: this is something that should happen on exceptional circumstances with the GM’s approval. A character may die in the following scenarios: Receiving massive damage, e.g. drop to negative HP equal or greater than their maximum HP. All PCs dropping unconscious in a dangerous situation. The GM should decide on the level of lethality they want for their campaign, and communicate this clearly to the players. That said, GMs should be aware that players can be punished for defeat in ways that do not require death of a PC: Instead of dying, a character may receive a permanent wound, such as a -1 penalty to Stamina, Movement, Fortitude, Reflex, Will or to an Ability Skill bonus. Alternately, a valuable Magic Item may be permanently destroyed instead. When the entire party drops unconscious in combat, they may be taken prisoner, or suffer permanent wounds as described above. Or some PCs may die while others survive. In a campaign with magical healing, it may be possible to recover from permanent wounds, or even death - see the Ritual chapter for optional rules on this. At any rate, such healing should never be too easy, and there should always be a significant cost involved. "],

Tip:Note that we use Monsters as shorthand for “bad guys”, and it is perfectly possible to have a Monster team composed of non-monstruous mundane characters like human bandits or wolves. Or they can also be, you know, many-eyed tentacled abominations. In combat, each character (whether a Player Character or a Monster) takes turns to carry out actions such as moving, attacking enemies, or healing or assisting allies. Some actions succeed automatically, whereas others require the character to make a successful die roll. For example, movement through normal terrain is resolved automatically, with the player stating the character’s movement path and changing the character’s position accordingly. On the other hand, attacking requires the character to roll against the enemy’s defense to determine if the attack hits, and then rolling again to determine the damage dealt by the attack. Tip: Generally, to make a die roll in the game a player rolls a 20-sided die (aka. d20), adds the appropriate bonus from their Character Sheet, plus any modifiers that apply, and tries to beat a target number, like a Check Difficulty or an enemy defense stat. Another common type of die roll is the damage roll, which is made after hitting with an attack. In a damage roll, the player rolls several dice of a type determined by the attack, adds a damage bonus and uses the total as the amount of inflicted damage. The goal of a combat encounter is incapacitate all enemy characters, typically by inflicting enough damage to reduce them below 0 Hit Points. A combat can also end when either the monsters or the Player Characters decide to flee. 5.2 The Combat Map 5.2.1 Distances The following figure illustrates how distances work. The number in each square represent the distance between the Wizard and that square. Map distances This figure shows some specific examples of squares that are 1,2,3,4, and 5 units away from the Wizard Map distance examples 5.2.2 Lines Due to the way that distances are defined in our maps, certain geometrical elements like lines are not as straightforward as one would expect. In the game map, a Line is: one of the shortest paths between two points (note that there can be several paths that meet this requirement!) composed of up to two straight segments: one in the horizontal or vertical direction, and another in a diagonal direction. For any two points in the map, there will be one or two Lines that meet this definition. This figure shows the simplest types of lines, composed of a single horizontal (1), vertical (2) or diagonal (3, 4) segment. Note that when two points can be joined by a single-segment Line, there will only be a single Line between these points. Line definition This figure shows examples of two-segment lines. When two points can be joined by a two-segment line, there will always be two such lines between these points.

A character can take 1 Move Action/turn Standard : Action taken during a character’s turn, usually to make an attack. A character can take 1 Standard Action/turn Minor : Action taken during a character’s turn, usually for something quick like picking up an object. A character can take 1 Minor Action/turn. Free : Action taken during a character’s turn. Can be in response to a trigger. Reaction : Action taken outside a character’s turn, in response to a trigger. A character can take 1 Reaction/Round. Free Reaction : Action taken outside a character’s turn, in response to a trigger. Counts as both a Free Action and a Reaction. Does not count toward the limit of 1 Reaction/Round. Reaction Keywords: The following keywords can apply to Reactions, Free Reactions, and to Free Actions with a trigger, to grant them special properties: Interrupt : Reaction resolves before the triggering event completes. Automatic : Can always be taken, even if the character is Unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions at that time. Resolving Interrupts: An Interrupt action triggering in the middle of another character’s action can stop the triggering action. For example, a character Immobilized by an Interrupt while moving stops their movement immediately. An Interrupt action can include Forced Movement. A character whose position changed because of an interrupt may find that some targets for the triggering action are now at a different range, or outside of range altogether. In that case, apply any new range modifiers as appropriate, and remove any out of range characters as valid targets. No new targets can be picked - if the triggering action no longer has enough valid targets, it stops. If the interrupted action included movement, and the Interrupt caused Forced Movement, the interrupted character subtracts the distance of the Forced Movement from the remaining movement distance. Then, if they have any movement distance left, they use it to move to a new position. This new position does not need to match the movement as declared before the interrupt. Opportunity Attacks : The most common type of Reaction is the Opportunity Attack, a combat maneuver that all characters can make to attack adjacent enemies moving or making ranged attacks: Opportunity Attack - Maneuver Attack Free Reaction (Interrupt) - (Trigger: An adjacent enemy moves or makes a Ranged or Area attack) - Effect: You make a Melee Basic Attack against the triggering enemy, adding your Opportunity Modifier to the Hit Roll Compatibility Note: Automatic actions were known as No Action in legacy rules. Limits to actions: During a character’s turn: One each of : Minor Action, Move Action, Standard Action. One Free Action Attack. Any number of non-attack Free Actions, but each power can only be used once per turn this way. Outside a character’s turn: One non-Free Reaction per round. One Free Reaction attack per turn. Any number of non-attack Free Reactions per turn, but each power can only be used once per turn this way. An Automatic action can always be taken, at any time, regardless of other action limits. Compatibility Note: Legacy rules have granted actions as Free Actions. They are now Free Reactions. Example: “an ally can make a basic attack as a Free Action” becomes \"an ally can make a basic attack as a Free Reaction. Note: Effects that prevent a character from taking Reactions also stop Free Reactions. Note: Unless otherwise stated, reactions cannot trigger further reactions. Notably, Taunted characters making Opportunity Attacks will not trigger Reactions from the taunting characters. 5.6 Movement 5.7 Attacking 5.7.1 Range and Targeting 5.7.2 Hit Roll 5.7.2.1 Hit Modifiers Condition Modifier Defender grants Advantage to Attacker +2 Defender has any Cover from Attacker -2 Defender has Superior Cover from Attacker -3 Defender has any Concealment from Attacker, attack is Melee or Ranged -2 Defender has Superior Concealment from Attacker, attack is Melee or Ranged -3 Attacker is Hindered -2 Ranged attack at Long Range -2 Note: Characters with Superior Cover also benefit from regular Cover, so attacks against them will have a total modifier of -5. Likewise, Characters with Superior Concealment also benefit from regular Concealment, and attacks against them have a total modifier of -5. 5.7.2.2 Critical Hits 5.7.3 Damage Roll 5.7.3.1 Miss Damage 5.8 Status Effects Some powers or abilities can apply status effects on characters. A character afflicted by a status effect suffers penalties that depend on the type condition - see the table below for details. Normally, the effect creating a status effect states its duration, which is often a combat turn, but can also last until the character saves against the effect, or even indefinitely, depending on the case. Certain status effects have special rules affecting their duration, typically in the form of conditions that end the effect prematurely. It is possible for a character to be affected by multiple instances of a status effect. The penalties from instances of the same condition don’t stack unless otherwise stated. Some status effects care about the source of the effect. For example, in the case of the Taunt status effect, the Taunted character does not suffer penalties when attacking the Taunting character. If multiple instances of such an effect are affecting a character, it is important to keep track of the source of each one. 5.8.1 Downgrading status effects Some abilities allow a character to downgrade a status effect. To downgrade a status effect, check the Downgrade column in the status effect table: the character treats the status effect as if it was the downgraded one for the duration of the downgrade. Note that a downgrade may have a shorter duration than the status effect it applies to - in that case, the original effect applies again when the Downgrade ends. If the downgrade for a status effect is listed as No Effect, the effect is completely ignored while Downgraded. Likewise, if it is listed as No Downgrade, the effect cannot be downgraded. A status effect can only be downgraded once at any given time. Notably, this means that abilities that downgrade multiple types of status effect do not stack with themselves. As an example, consider a character with the ability to downgrade the Slowed and Immobilized status effects. If that character becomes Immobilized, the downgrade would allow them to act as if they were Slowed instead - but it wouldn’t let them ignore the Slow. 5.8.2 Standard Status Effects Status Downgrade Effects Blinded Dazzled - Grants Advantage (+2 to be hit)- Cannot Flank- Treats other characters or objects as having Superior Concealment (-5 to hit them).- No line of sight to other characters or objects- +1 DC to Perception Skill Checks.

Dazed Grants Advantage - Grants Advantage (+2 to be hit)- Cannot Flank- Cannot use Opportunity or Immediate Actions- Each turn, can use a Minor Action and either a Standard Action or a Move Action, Dazzled No Effect - Treats all enemies as having Concealment (-2 to hit them) or, if already in Concealment, as having Superior Concealment (an additional -3 to hit them). Dominated Charmed - Cannot take actions - When damaged, can roll a Save to end this condition. - The dominating character can spend a move action to make the dominated character move its speed. (This counts as forced movement) - The dominating character can spend a standard action to make the dominated character use an at-will attack. (This counts as a forced attack) Flanked No Downgrade - Grants Advantage on Melee attacks (+2 to be hit) Grabbed No Effect Cannot move -When grabbed, the character is pulled to a square adjacent to the grabbing character. -The condition ends if at any time the grabbed character is not adjacent to the grabbing character.-Grabbed character can use the Escape combat maneuver to end the condition. (Move Action, roll save to end grab from one enemy)-If forced movement would cause the grabbed character and the grabbing character to no longer be adjacent, the grabbed character can roll a Save to end this condition. If the condition doesn’t end this way, the forced movement is negated-A character may be Grabbed by multiple enemies at a time. Helpless No Downgrade - Grants Advantage (+2 to be hit)-Melee Attacks against the character gain +10 Crit Range Hindered No Effect -2 Hit Immobilized Slowed Cannot move Taunted No Downgrade - -2 Hit on attacks that ignore the Taunt (see sidebar) - A character may be Taunted by multiple enemies at a time. Petrified Stunned - Grants Advantage- Cannot take actions- Gains Resist (all). Prone No Downgrade Condition lasts indefinitely until the character stands up (e.g. by spending a move action on the Stand Up maneuver) -Cannot make any movement other than crawling (e.g. by having a Crawl Speed, or by using the Crawl combat maneuver: Move Action, crawl 1)-Hindered (-2 Hit)-Grants Advantage against melee attacks (+2 to be hit)-Against non-melee attacks, gains Cover (-2 cover penalty to attack rolls) or, if already in Cover, gains Total Cover (an additional -3 cover penalty to attack rolls) Restrained Grabbed - Cannot move - Ignores forced movement - Grants Advantage (+2 to be hit) - Hindered (-2 Hit) Slowed No Effect - For each square moved, must spend an additional square of movement Stunned Dazed -Cannot attack -Cannot move -Can only take one action per turn -Cannot use Reactions -Grants Advantage (+2 to be hit) Unconscious No Downgrade - When a character falls unconscious, they are knocked prone. -When damaged, if the character has 1 or more remaining hit points after receiving the damage, the condition ends. - Helpless (+2 to be hit, enemy melee attacks gain +10 Crit Range) - Cannot take actions - Cannot see. Weakened Fatigued - Damage dealt is halved - Healing granted or received is halved - Shield Points granted or received are halved Fatigued No Effect - Damage dealt is reduced by 1/4 - Healing granted or received is reduced by 1/4 - Shield Points granted or received are reduced by 1/4 Tip - Hindered: Many types of action can cause a character to be Hindered for a turn. These include combat maneuvers like Shift, Charge, Stand Up, Quick Draw, Sidebar: ignoring Taunts An attack by a Taunted character ignores a Taunt if it targets an enemy not taunting the character. The following exceptions apply: If the attack targets multiple characters, and all enemies taunting the character are already targeted, any additional targets do not ignore the Taunt. If multiple attacks are made in sequence as part of the same attack power (e.g. primary and secondary attacks), once all enemies Taunting the character have been targeted at least once, any additional targets do not ignore the Taunt. If an attack originally does not ignore the Taunt, and the attack targets are somehow changed by an enemy action or other effect, this does not cause the attack to ignore the Taunt. If an attack originally does not ignore the Taunt, and the attacker becomes Taunted during the attack (e.g. by an enemy reaction), this does not cause the attack to ignore the mark. Compatibility Note: Defender Aura Some characters in compatible books have the Defender Aura power. The effect of this power should be replaced with the following: “Enemies in the aura are Taunted by you.” Compatibility Note: ignoring Taunts Any reference from compatible books to effects that trigger when a Taunted character ‘makes an attack that does not include the Taunting character as a target’ should use the rules for ignoring Taunts described above. 5.8.3 Stealth status effects These effects are used by characters trying to hide in combat. Unlike other status effects, these are mostly beneficial and often entered voluntarily. Status Effects Ends Shrouded Cannot be targeted by Ranged attacks, or Reaction attacks -Cannot be Charged -Cannot make Reaction attacks Condition is lost: -After attacking -After moving - If, at the end of a character’s action, the Shrouded character doesn’t have Cover (other than Body Cover) or Concealment against all enemies. Hidden Cannot make Reaction attacks -Gains Advantage when attacking -Cannot be targeted by Melee or Ranged powers -Cannot be targeted by a Close or Area power unless it targets a non-Hidden character. -Location unknown to other characters Condition is lost: - After attacking - After moving - If, at the end of a character’s action, the Hidden character doesn’t have Cover (other than Body Cover) or Concealment against all enemies. Tip: Although a Hidden character´s current location is unknown, other characters can guess it based on context: where the Hidden character was last seen, what suitable hiding locations are in the area, etc. Clarification: Actions that grant the Shrouded or Hidden condition do not cause the loss of that condition if they include attacks or movement. 5.8.4 Special Status Effects These effectsare rarely used, typically by monsters. Status Downgrade Effects Swallowed Grabbed -When swallowed, a character disappears from its current position. When the condition ends, the character reappears in a square of his choice as close as possible to the swallower. - Can spend a move action to make an Escape Check (see sidebar). If successful, condition ends. - Does not occupy a space. - Can only take one action per turn. - Only has line of effect and line of sight to and from the swallower, and other characters and objects swallowed by it. - The inside of the swallower, and swallowed characters and objects, are in total darkness unless otherwise specified. Swallowed characters can use any light source to illuminate the inside of the swallower and all characters and objects swallowed by it. - When using a burst or blast power while swallowed, the swallower and all characters and objects swallowed by it are included in the burst or blast. Exiled Grabbed - When exiled, a character disappears from its current position. - When the condition ends, the character reappears on this position or, if not possible, in the closest ground square of his choice, unless the exiling effect states otherwise. - Does not occupy a space. - No line of sight to and from other creatures or objects unless the exiling effect states otherwise. - No line of effect to and from other creatures or objects unless the exiling effect states otherwise. 5.8.5 Legacy status effects In legacy rules, status effects are referred to as conditions. Some status effects have been renamed from legacy rules: Deafened: Renamed to Dazzled 5.8.6 Forced Attacks Certain powers or effects allow one character to force an enemy to make an attack. Such attacks are considered forced attacks, and use the following rules: If there are different attack powers that meet the requirement for the forced attack (e.g. basic attacks or at-will attacks), the character forcing the attack is aware of all available options and can choose any of them. For the chosen attack power, the character forcing the attack can make any relevant decision, including (but not limited to) targets, area of effect, forced movement caused by the attack. A character forced to make an attack cannot target himself with the forced attack. Forced attacks ignore the Taunted status effect . A character making a forced attack counts as not Taunted, for the purposes of that attack. Forced attacks never trigger opportunity attacks. 5.9 Forced Movement Certain powers or effects allow one character to force an enemy to make a move. Such movements are considered forced movement, and use the following rules: - Forced Movement can be caused by Push, Pull and Slide effects. In these cases, the amount of squares of forced movement is indicated in the effect causing the forced movement. - If a Push, Pull or Slide effect ends before the full distance is moved because the moved character collides with an obstacle or another character, each character involved in the collision takes Forced Movement Damage. This damage scales with the tier of the source of the forced movement as follows: 1d4 for Heroic sources, 2d4 for Paragon effects for Paragon sources, and 4d4 for Epic sources. - Forced Movement can also be caused by effects that force the character to take an action to move in a particular direction. In this case, the amount of squares of forced movement depends on the character’s speed unless otherwise stated, and is affected by any status effects or other conditions that restrict movement. - Forced movement never triggers opportunity attacks or other character powers that would trigger on movement. Traps and hazardous terrain trigger normally. 5.9.1 Push Push a single unit Push 1 Push a single unit, showing Lines Push 1 Push multiple units Push multiple squares Push multiple units, showing Lines for path Push multiple squares Push single unit at range, showing Lines Push at range Push multiple units at range, showing Lines Push at range 5.9.1.1 Pull Pull at range Pull 5.9.1.2 Slide Slide a single unit, at range (1) and in melee (2) Slide Slide multiple units, at range (1) and in melee (2) Slide 5.9.2 Saving against Forced Movement Characters can use Forced Movement to get their opponents into a damaging area, or to crash them into a wall. This is considered fair game, and no saves are normally allowed. However, there is an exception to this: whenever forced movement would move a character off a cliff (or equivalent) and cause them to fall, that character is allowed to make a save to avoid the effect. The character takes a penalty to the save equal to the remaining squares of Forced Movement. On a successful save, the Forced Movement stops before the character is moved off the cliff, and the character is knocked prone. At the GM’s discretion, PCs (but not monsters) can also benefit from this rule whenever Forced Movement would put them in a particularly deadly position, such as a pool of lava. Example 1: A goblin is adjacent to a precipice. A PC uses an attack with Push 1 to try to make the goblin fall: the goblin can attempt a save without penalties to avoid this effect and become Prone instead. Example 2: A goblin is 1 square away from a precipice. A PC uses an attack with Push 4 to try to make the goblin fall: the goblin can attempt a save to avoid this effect and become Prone instead. Since there are 4 squares of forced movement and 2 are spent to move the character over the precipice, the excess distance is 2 squares, and the goblin takes a -2 penalty to the save. 5.10 Combat Maneuvers 5.10.1 PC Maneuvers Melee Basic Attack (Weapon) - Maneuver Attack - Weapon Melee - Primary Ability vs Arm Hit: 1W+Primary Ability.

["feats-1.html", "Chapter 9 Feats 9.1 Level 1 Combat Feats 9.2 Level 1 Optional Feats: Training 9.3 Level 4 Combat Feats 9.4 Level 11 Combat Feats 9.5 Level 21 Combat Feats", " Chapter 9 Feats 9.1 Level 1 Combat Feats Players can choose level 1 Combat feats from the following categories: Defense Focus: Feats that improve a character’s Arm while wearing certain armors, and provide a small additional bonus. Offense Focus: Feats that improve a character’s attacks with certain weapons or implements, and provide a small additional bonus. Toughness: Feats that improve a character’s HP, and provide a small additional bonus. Class Focus: Feats that allow a character to pick a second class or specialize on their current class. Note that Offense Focus is the largest feat Category in the game and, due to its size, has been split into three parts for the sake of readability: Offense Focus (Flexible): Feats that boost both weapon and implement attacks. Offense Focus (Weapon): Feats that boost weapon attacks. Offense Focus (Implement): Feats that boost implement attacks. Tip: The Toughness feat (from the Category of the same name) is a good level 1 Feat for starting players who don’t want to complicate themselves. Tip: Feats in the Toughness Category are generally better than Defense Focus feats at providing raw survivability. Feats in the Defense Focus Category are usually better at providing protection against melee attacks, or for characters that are interested in their secondary benefits. When in doubt, take both. Tip: Offense Focus Feats are the one of the main reasons to choose one Weapon Family over another, or one type of Implement over another. The other reason is the player’s aesthetic preference - some people just like axes a lot. Players who carefully study all options to choose the one that best suits their character build will probably gain a small edge in combat, but the Feats are designed to be close in power level, so choosing based on personal taste will be almost as effective. 9.1.1 Toughness Toughness Toughness - Level 1 Gain extra HP::+5 HP:+15 HP:+30 HP Surging Toughness Toughness - Level 1 Increase your Surge Value::+5 Surge Value:+15 Surge Value:+30 Surge Value Die Hard Toughness - Level 1 +4 to Death Saves.extra HP::+3 HP:+9 HP:+18 HP Toughness in Numbers Toughness - Level 1 Increase your Surge Value and the HP of your Animal Companions, Familiars and Summoned creatures::+3 Surge Value, +6 companion HP.:+9 Surge Value, +18 companion HP.:+18 Surge Value, +36 companion HP. 9.1.2 Category - Defense Focus Wind Robes Defense Focus - Level 1 Keywords: Armor, Cloth While wearing Cloth Armor, +1 Arm, and +1 Arm vs ranged Elemental Robes Defense Focus - Level 1 Keywords: Armor, Cloth When taking this feat, choose one of the following damage types: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Radiant, Psychic.

Weapon Training: Feats that provide training with new types of weapons. Tip: Armor Training is usually not as strong as Defense Focus, but they both stack, and you can take multiple Training feats. Tip: For characters without training in martial weapons, Weapon Trainer is often superior to an Offense Focus feat. Tip: There is no Implement Training Feat. If you are really interested in using a different Implement, go Multiclass and take Multiclass Implement or, alternately, convince your GM that you want it for story reasons and not to optimize your character. GM Tip: If your player is really interested in getting training with a different Implement, allow them to have it for free if they provide a convincing argument. When in doubt, make it conditional on them taking an Offense Focus Feat that is not specific to that implement, such as Dual Focus. Designer Note: GMs should feel free to leave these feats out of the game, particularly for beginning players. From a mechanical standpoint, the feats are redundant with Offense Focus and Defense Focus feats, and slightly imbalanced, as they are often clearly weaker or stronger than the alternatives. We have included them as optional categories because they are a cool tool to customize a character’s look and feel, and for many game groups that will be worth the slight tradeoff in game balance. 9.2.1 Category - Armor Training Leather Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Gain Training with Leather Armor Hide Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Leather Armor Training Gain Training with Hide Armor Chain Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Leather Armor Training Gain Training with Chain Armor Scale Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Chain Armor Training Gain Training with Scale Armor Plate Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Scale Armor Training Gain Training with Plate Armor Light Shield Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Gain Training with Light Shield Heavy Shield Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Light Shield Training Gain Training with Heavy Shield 9.2.2 Category - Weapon Training Martial Weapon Training Weapon Training - Level 1 Keywords: Weapon Gain Training in all Simple weapons and One-Hand Martial weapons.

Class Skills Perception 11.2 Minion Monsters Unlike most characters, minions do not have a HP value - do not keep track of damage done to minions. Instead, use the following: Minions have a damage threshold value. Whenever a minion receives damage equal or greater than their damage threshold, they are automatically incapacitated. If a character damages a minion multiple times in the same turn (e.g. with several weak attacks) and the total damage that turn exceeds the minion’s damage threshold, the minion is also automatically incapacitated. A minion that takes damage below their damage threshold is knocked prone instead. Prone minions that are targeted by an attack or take any damage are automatically incapacitated. A minion that starts their turn Prone must make a saving throw - on a failed save, they can take no actions that turn. In addition, most minions have Partial Vulnerability (Melee or Ranged), included in their stats. 11.2.1 Minion Races, Heroic Humanoid Level 1 Kobold Minion Small - Humanoid Movement 6 Base Stats Def H D E 0 4 4 1 HP Hi 7 Mid 6 Low 5 Resistances Partial Vuln.
