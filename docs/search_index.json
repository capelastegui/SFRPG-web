Offense Focus: Feats that improve a characters attacks with certain weapons or implements, and provide a small additional bonus. Toughness: Feats that improve a characters HP, and provide a small additional bonus. Class Focus: Feats that allow a character to pick a second class or specialize on their current class. Note that Offense Focus is the largest feat Category in the game and, due to its size, has been split into three parts for the sake of readability: Offense Focus (Flexible): Feats that boost both weapon and implement attacks. Offense Focus (Weapon): Feats that boost weapon attacks. Offense Focus (Implement): Feats that boost implement attacks. Tip: The Toughness feat (from the Category of the same name) is a good level 1 Feat for starting players who dont want to complicate themselves. Tip: Feats in the Toughness Category are generally better than Defense Focus feats at providing raw survivability. Feats in the Defense Focus Category are usually better at providing protection against melee attacks, or for characters that are interested in their secondary benefits. When in doubt, take both. Tip: Offense Focus Feats are the one of the main reasons to choose one Weapon Family over another, or one type of Implement over another. The other reason is the players aesthetic preference - some people just like axes a lot. Players who carefully study all options to choose the one that best suits their character build will probably gain a small edge in combat, but the Feats are designed to be close in power level, so choosing based on personal taste will be almost as effective. 9.1.1 Toughness Toughness Toughness - Level 1 Gain extra HP:- [H]:+5 HP- [P]:+15 HP- [E]:+30 HP Surging Toughness Toughness - Level 1 Increase your Surge Value:- [H]:+5 Surge Value- [P]:+15 Surge Value- [E]:+30 Surge Value Die Hard Toughness - Level 1 +4 to Death Saves.extra HP:- [H]:+3 HP- [P]:+9 HP- [E]:+18 HP Toughness in Numbers Toughness - Level 1 Increase your Surge Value and the HP of your Animal Companions, Familiars and Summoned creatures:- [H]:+3 Surge Value, +6 companion HP.- [P]:+9 Surge Value, +18 companion HP.- [E]:+18 Surge Value, +36 companion HP. 9.1.2 Category - Defense Focus Wind Robes Defense Focus - Level 1 Keywords: Armor, Cloth While wearing Cloth Armor, +1 Arm, and +1 Arm vs ranged Elemental Robes Defense Focus - Level 1 Keywords: Armor, Cloth When taking this feat, choose one of the following damage types: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Radiant, Psychic.While wearing Cloth Armor, +1 Arm, and Resist (chosen damage type).

Weapon Training: Feats that provide training with new types of weapons. Tip: Armor Training is usually not as strong as Defense Focus, but they both stack, and you can take multiple Training feats. Tip: For characters without training in martial weapons, Weapon Training is often superior to an Offense Focus feat. Tip: There is no Implement Training Feat. If you are really interested in using a different Implement, go Multiclass and take Multiclass Implement or, alternatively, convince your GM that you want it for story reasons and not to optimize your character. GM Tip: If your player is really interested in getting training with a different Implement, allow them to have it for free if they provide a convincing argument. When in doubt, make it conditional on them taking an Offense Focus Feat that is not specific to that implement, such as Dual Focus. Designer Note: GMs should feel free to leave these feats out of the game, particularly for beginning players. From a mechanical standpoint, the feats are redundant with Offense Focus and Defense Focus feats, and slightly imbalanced, as they are often clearly weaker or stronger than the alternatives. We have included them as optional categories because they are a cool tool to customize a characters look and feel, and for many game groups that will be worth the slight tradeoff in game balance. 9.2.1 Category - Armor Training Leather Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Gain Training with Leather Armor Hide Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Leather Armor Training Gain Training with Hide Armor Chain Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Leather Armor Training Gain Training with Chain Armor Scale Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Chain Armor Training Gain Training with Scale Armor Plate Armor Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Scale Armor Training Gain Training with Plate Armor Light Shield Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Gain Training with Light Shield Heavy Shield Training Armor Training - Level 1 Keywords: Armor Requires: Light Shield Training Gain Training with Heavy Shield 9.2.2 Category - Weapon Training Martial Weapon Training Weapon Training - Level 1 Keywords: Weapon Gain Training in all Simple weapons and One-Hand Martial weapons.
