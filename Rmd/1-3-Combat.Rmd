In this chapter we provide the rules for resolving a combat encounter.

##Combat Fundamentals

In Square Fireballs, a combat encounter represents a short, violent conflict between an adventuring party of Player Characters and a group of Monsters controlled by the Game Master. 

<div class="tip">**Tip**:Note that we use **Monsters** as shorthand for "bad guys", and it is perfectly possible to have a Monster team composed of non-monstruous mundane characters like human bandits or wolves. Or they can also be, you know, many-eyed tentacled abominations.</div>

In combat, each character (whether a Player Character or a Monster) takes **turns** to carry out **actions** such as moving, attacking enemies, or healing or assisting allies. Some actions succeed automatically, whereas others require the character to make a successful die roll. For example, movement through normal terrain is resolved automatically, with the player stating the character's movement path and changing the character's position accordingly. On the other hand, attacking requires the character to roll against the enemy's defense to determine if the attack hits, and then rolling again to determine the damage dealt by the attack.

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Generally, to make a dice check in the game a player rolls a 20-sided die (aka. d20), adds the appropriate bonus from their Character Sheet, plus any modifiers that apply, and tries to beat a target number, like a Check Difficulty or an enemy defense stat. Another common type of die roll is the damage roll, which is made after hitting with an attack. In a damage roll, the player rolls several dice of a type determined by the attack, adds a damage bonus and uses the total as the amount of inflicted damage.</div>

The goal of a combat encounter is incapacitate all enemy characters, typically by inflicting enough damage to reduce them below 0 Hit Points. A combat can also end when either the monsters or the Player Characters decide to flee.





## The Combat Map



### Distances

The following figure illustrates how distances work. The number in each square represent the distance between the Wizard and that square.

![Map distances](figures/I_1_1_Distances.png)

This figure shows some specific examples of squares that are 1,2,3,4, and 5 units away from the Wizard

![Map distance examples](figures/I_1_2_Distances2.png)

### Lines

Due to the way that distances are defined in our maps, certain geometrical elements like lines are not as straightforward as one would expect. In the game map, a Line is:

- one of the shortest paths between two points (note that there can be several paths that meet this requirement!)
- composed of up to two straight segments: one in the horizontal or vertical direction, and another in a diagonal direction. 

For any two points in the map, there will be one or two Lines that meet this definition.

This figure shows the simplest types of lines, composed of a single horizontal (1), vertical (2) or diagonal (3, 4) segment. Note that when two points can be joined by a single-segment Line, there will only be a single Line between these points.

![Line definition](figures/I_2_1_Lines.png)

This figure shows examples of two-segment lines. When two points can be joined by a two-segment line, there will always be two such lines between these points.

    - Grants Advantage (+2 to be hit)
    - Cannot Flank
    - Treats other characters or objects as having Superior Concealment (-5 to hit them).
    - No line of sight to other characters or objects

- Dazed
    - Cannot Flank
    - Cannot use Opportunity or Immediate Actions
    - Each turn, can use only:
        - One minor action, and
        - Either one standard action or one move action

    - Treats all enemies as having Concealment (-2 to hit them) or, if already in Concealment, as having Superior Concealment (-5 to hit them).


- Deafened
    - Grants Advantage
    - Cannot use Search Maneuver.
    - +1 Difficulty Category to Perception Checks.


- Dominated
    - Cannot take actions
    - When damaged, can make saving throw against domination, condition ends on successful save
    - Dominator can spend a move action to make the dominated character move its speed. This counts as forced movement.
    - Dominator can spend a standard action to make the dominated character use an at-will attack. This counts as a forced attack.

<div class="tip">
Sidebar: Forced attack

Certain powers or effects allow one character to force an enemy to make an attack. Such attacks are considered forced attacks, and use the following rules:

If there are different attack powers that meet the requirement for the forced attack (e.g. basic attacks or at-will attacks), the character forcing the attack is aware of all available options and can choose any of them.

For the chosen attack power, the character forcing the attack can make any relevant decision, including (but not limited to) targets, area of effect, forced movement caused by the attack.

A character forced to make an attack cannot target himself with the forced attack.

Forced attacks ignore the marked condition. A character making a forced attack counts as not marked, for the purposes of that attack.

Forced attacks never trigger opportunity attacks.
</div>

- Grabbed
    - When grabbed, character is pulled adjacent to grabber
    - Condition ends if at any time the character is not adjacent to grabber
    - Can spend a move action to make an Escape Check (see sidebar). If successful, condition ends.
    - Cannot move
    - If forced movement would cause the character and the grabber to no longer be adjacent, character can make an Escape Check (see sidebar) as a free action. If successful, condition ends. If the check fails or is not taken, the forced movement is negated.

<div class="tip">
Sidebar: Escape Check

Characters can make Escape Checks to end conditions like Grabbed or Swallowed, usually by spending a move action.

Check: choose one of the following:

Acrobatics vs Reflex of condition source

Athletics vs Fortitude of condition source
</div>

- Helpless

    - Grants Advantage
    - Can be attacked with Coup de Grace

- Immobilized
    - Cannot move

- Marked
    - -2 mark penalty to attack rolls of attacks that violate mark (see sidebar)

<div class="tip">
Sidebar: Violating marks

An attack violates a mark if it targets one or more enemies and does not include the marker as a target. The following exceptions apply:

If multiple attacks are made simultaneously as part of the same attack power, none of the attacks violate the mark as long as the marker is the target of at least one attack.

If multiple attacks are made in sequence as part of the same attack power (e.g. primary and secondary attacks), once an attack is made that includes the marker as a target, none of the subsequent attacks violate the mark.

If an attack initially includes the marker as a target and is later prevented from including the marker as a target by an effect controlled by an enemy (e.g. a power changing attack targets), this attack does not violate the mark.

If a character is marked while making an attack (e.g. by an Interrupt power that marks), that attack does not violate the mark.

Note: Any power or effect that triggers when a marked character makes an attack that does not include the marking character as a target should be updated to trigger when a marked character makes an attack that violates the mark, and use the rules described above.
</div>

<div class="tip">
Sidebar: Defender Aura

The text on defender aura should be replaced with the following:

“Enemies in the aura are marked”

(Note that the new rules for stacking conditions mean that a mark no longer overrides other marks or defender auras, and a character can be simultaneously marked by multiple enemies).
</div>

- Petrified
    - Grants Advantage
    - Cannot take actions
    - Gains Resist (all) [Note: New rules for resistances will be added in a future article. For the purposes of this condition, read this as “halve all damage taken”].
