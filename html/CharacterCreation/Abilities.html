    <p>Ability scores</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability Score: An ability score is the modifier, usually between -1
        and +5, that is applied to attack rolls, skills, and many power effects
        (e.g. Str +4, Dex +1, …)</li>
      <li>Damage modifier: A damage modifier is the ability-related modifier
        that applies to damage and healing effects, instead of the ability
        score. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>It is generated by taking the ability score, and applying a
          multiplier based on level:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Level 1: x1</li>
          <li>Level 3: x1.5</li>
          <li>Level 9: x2</li>
          <li>Level 13: x3</li>
          <li>Level 19: x4</li>
          <li>Level 23: x5</li>
          <li>Level 29: x6</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>It applies whenever an ability modifier is required for the following
        stats:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage</li>
        <ul>
          <li>damage roll</li>
          <li>granted bonus to damage</li>
          <li>granted penalty to damage</li>
          <li>ongoing damage</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Healing</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Shield Points (aka. Temporary Hit Points)</li>
          <li>Surge Value (aka. Healing Surge Value)</li>
          <li>Regeneration</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Favored Racial Ability: Character races can typically choose up to two
        Favored Racial Abilities. When a character’s Favored Racial Abilities
        match their Primary or Secondary ability scores, they gain a bonus:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary or Secondary abilities match one Favored Racial Ability:
          Gain bonus Lesser Feat - Skill Training.</li>
        <li>Primary and Secondary abilities match two Favored Racial Abilities:
          Gain 2 bonus Lesser Feats - Skill Training, Skill Focus.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      Generating Ability Scores</p>
    <ul>
      <li>During character generation, the player can choose between two
        different arrays for ability generation, Focused and Flexible. Focused
        ability arrays maximize the Primary Ability, whereas Flexible ability
        arrays have slightly lower Primary Abilities in exchange for higher
        Secondary and Tertiary Abilities:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Focused Array: Primary +5,Secondary +2, Tertiaries +0; Weak -1</li>
        <li>Flexible Array: Primary +4, Secondary +3, Tertiaries +1; Weak -1</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Once an Ability Array has been selected, the Primary Ability is
        determined by the choice of Class and Class Build. The Secondary Ability
        may also be determined by the Class Build, or be left open to the
        player’s choice. The player must choose one of the 4 remaining abilities
        to be their character’s Weak Ability. The 3 other abilities are Tertiary
        Abilities. Scores for each abilities are assigned according to the
        chosen Ability Array.</li>
      <li>The following stats are derived from a character’s abilities. Note
        that further modifiers can be applied from Class Features, Feats, and
        other sources:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Secondary Defenses</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Fortitude: Highest score of Strength and Constitution</li>
          <li>Reflex: Highest score of Dexterity and Wisdom</li>
          <li>Will: Highest score of Charisma and Intelligence</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Secondary Stats</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Opportunity Attack Modifier: Highest score of Strength and Wisdom,
            minus 4</li>
          <li>Surges: Highest score of Constitution and Charisma, plus class
            surges.</li>
          <li>Initiative: Highest score of Dexterity and Intelligence, minus
            Armor Penalty.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Note: Ability Scores have no impact on a character’s AC or HP.</li>
    </ul>
