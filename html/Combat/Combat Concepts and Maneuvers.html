    <p>Implement basic attack<br>
      A player character may pick an implement basic attack if they meet the
      following conditions:<br>
      Proficiency with an implement<br>
      an Implement attack power<br>
      A character can only have one implement basic attack.<br>
      When picking an implement basic attack, the player chooses a damage type
      shared from one of their implement attack powers. That is the damage type
      for the implement basic attack. The player then chooses a defense targeted
      by that implement attack power. That is the defense targeted by the
      implement basic attack<br>
