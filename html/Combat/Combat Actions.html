  <body style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">Rules for Reactions:<br>
    Each character can use one Reaction per round.<br>
    Reactions can only be used during other character’s turns.<br>
    Preparation: Each turn, a character chooses a Reaction power to prepare for
    the round. That is the only Reaction that the character can use that round.
    <br>
    Upon preparation, the character can state additional restrictions for the
    triggering and resolution for the Reaction.<br>
    Trigger: A prepared Reaction is automatically activated when its trigger
    condition is met. The player has no input at this point. Note that a
    Reaction can never trigger further Reactions, even if it fulfills their
    trigger conditions. <br>
    Resolution: A prepared Reaction is automatically resolved once activated,
    and takes place after the action that triggered it is complete. The player
    has no input at this point. Any required decisions (targeting, movement,
    forced movement) are carried out at random, as explained below.<br>
    <br>
    Designer’s note: The rules for Reactions mean that players can only take
    game decisions during their characters’ turns, but characters can interact
    with each other at any point during a round.<br>
    <br>
    Special types of Reactions:<br>
    Spontaneous <br>
    Spontaneous Reactions do not count toward the limit of one Reaction per
    round.<br>
    However, a character can only use one Reaction per character turn, and each
    Reaction power can only be used once per round.<br>
    Spontaneous Reactions do not need to be prepared. Spontaneous Reactions are
    always ready to trigger.<br>
    A player can choose to disable one or more of their Spontaneous Reactions
    during their turn. These Reactions will not trigger until the player enables
    them again during their turn.<br>
    Spontaneous Reactions can also have additional keywords: Free, and
    Repeatable<br>
    Free:<br>
    Like Spontaneous Reactions, but they do not count toward the limit of one
    reaction per character turn. A character can use one Free Reaction per
    character turn, in addition to the usual one (non-Free) Reaction per
    character turn.<br>
    Repeatable<br>
    Like Spontaneous Reactions, but they ignore the limit of a single use per
    round of an individual Reaction power. A Repeatable Spontaneous Reaction can
    be used any number of times per round, but still only once per character
    turn.<br>
    Personal<br>
    Personal Reactions can be used during the reacting character’s turn, but not
    during other character’s turns. They are only triggered by the reacting
    character’s own actions.<br>
    Interrupt<br>
    An Interrupt Reaction resolves in the middle of the action that triggered
    it, interrupting it.<br>

    diagram below for break points of an attack power, and effect of
    interrupting on each of them.<br>
    Preparing reactions<br>
    At the end of turn, a character chooses a single Reaction power. That is the
    only Limited Reaction that can trigger that turn.<br>
    At the end of turn, a character orders Spontaneous Reactions by priority<br>
    At the end of turn, a character may disable any Spontaneous Reaction, to
    prevent it from triggering<br>
    A character sheet should state a default priority order for reactions. This
    is used whenever the player does not explicitly state one.<br>
    <br>
    Note: If seen as too complex, the following section can be replaced by “when
    multiple options are available for a Reaction, choose one at random”. This
    is an attempt to generate somewhat intelligent decisions, as opposed to
    fully randomized ones.<br>
    <br>
    Taking decisions during Reactions<br>
    <br>
    Players can provide no input at the time of resolving a reaction. Decisions
    are taken at random, according to the following guidelines.<br>
    Forced movement:<br>
    If one or more spaces with dangerous terrain are available, choose one at
    random.<br>
    Otherwise, if one or more spaces are available where the target is flanked
    and not flanking, choose one at random.<br>
    Otherwise, choose an available space at random, at the maximum forced
    movement distance.<br>
    Movement:<br>
    Any destination squares that are in Dangerous Terrain or that can only be
    reached by paths that normally provoke Opportunity Attacks are not
    considered valid destinations.<br>
    Note: Movement during a reaction would not actually provoke Opportunity
    Attacks. Nevertheless, paths that <br>
    If one or more destination squares are available where the character is
    flanking and not flanked, choose one at random.<br>
    Otherwise, choose an available space at random, at the maximum allowed
    movement distance.<br>
    Triggering:<br>
    If multiple Reactions are triggered simultaneously for the same character,
    choose one at random to resolve first.<br>
    Targeting:<br>
    If multiple valid targets are available, choose one at random.<br>
    Basic Attacks<br>
    If a Reaction (like an Opportunity Attack) allows a character to use a Basic
    Attack, and the character has multiple powers that can be used in this
    context, choose one at random.<br>
    Optionally, a player may define a default power to use as Basic Attack or
    for Opportunity Attacks. This default power can be modified during the
    character’s turn.<br>
    Other<br>
    If a Reaction presents multiple options not matching the examples above,
    choose one at random.<br>
    Restricting decisions during preparation<br>
    When preparing a Reaction during their turn, a player may choose to
    define&nbsp; additional restrictions to its triggering condition or
    available decisions. The following restrictions are allowed:<br>
    Trigger [a power that triggers when hit by an enemy] only on attacks by
    non-minions.<br>
    Trigger [a power that triggers when hit by an enemy] only while bloodied.<br>
    Forced movement moves as close as possible to a chosen character or object.<br>
    Forced movement moves as far as possible from a chosen character or object.<br>
    Movement to destinations as close as possible to a chosen character or
    object.<br>
    Movement to destinations as far as possible from a chosen character or
    object.<br>
    Optionally, the DM may allow other restrictions at their discretion.<br>
    Note: If a playtester comes up with a new, useful restriction, it could be
    added to this list.<br>
