    <h3>Condition source</h3>
    <p>We define condition source as the entity (typically an enemy character)
      imposing a given condition on a character. </p>
    <p>The effects of certain conditions are dependent on their condition
      source. In these cases, the source is referred by a condition-specific
      name for convenience - as an example, the source for the grabbed condition
      is called grabber. A list of source-dependent conditions, and the
      associated source names, is given below:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <p>Condition - Source</p>
      <p>Dominated - Dominator</p>
      <p>Grabbed - Grabber</p>
      <p>Marked- Marker</p>
      <p>Swallowed - Swallower</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3>Multiple instances of a condition</h3>
    <p>A character can be affected by multiple instances of a given condition.
      In this case, the character is treated as having a single instance of the
      condition: condition effects are not cumulative. However, players should
      keep track of each condition instance on their characters separately. The
      following rules apply for ending conditions in these scenarios: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A character is affected by a condition until all instances of the
          condition have ended on him.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each condition instance ends when its duration expires.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An effect that ends ‘a condition’ on the character (e.g. by allowing
          a saving throw) only ends a single instance, when multiples are
          present.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An effect that ends a condition type on the character (such as slow,
          or stun) ends all instances of that condition.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is possible to have multiple condition instances, each with a
      different condition source. For conditions that depend on their source,
      this means that some condition effects need to be evaluated against each
      source. The following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Dominated: A character dominated by multiple sources can be forced to
          move or attack by each dominator.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Marked: A character marked by multiple sources does not violate any
          mark as long as his attack includes at least one marker.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Grabbed: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A character grabbed by multiple sources that makes a Escape Check
              chooses one grabber, on a successful check, only condition
              instances associated with that grabber ends.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If at any time, a grabbed character is no longer adjacent to one
              grabber but remains adjacent to other grabbers, only condition
              instances associated with the non-adjacent grabber end.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Penalty types and stacking.</p>
    <p>(Note: This topic will be further developed in a separate article. I
      include this here since some conditions now reference penalty types)</p>
    <p>Like bonuses, penalties to rolls can have penalty types that determine
      how they stack with each other. The following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There are three penalty types: cover penalty, concealment penalty,
          and power penalty. In addition, a penalty can have no type, and be an
          untyped penalty.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When two or more penalties of the same type would apply to a roll,
          defense, or stat, use only the highest one.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Penalties of different types stack with each other.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rules for cover and concealment have been changed to match the new
      penalty types. Instead of the original attack modifiers for cover and
      concealment, use the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Concealment: -2 concealment penalty to attack roll</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Total Concealment: -5 concealment penalty to attack roll</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cover: -2 cover penalty to attack roll</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Total Cover: -5 cover penalty to attack roll</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>List of Conditions</p>
    <p>Blinded</p>
    <ul>

        <ul>
          <li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>One minor action, and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Either one standard action or one move action</p>
          </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Automatically fails perception checks and passive perception against
          characters or objects outside of line of sight.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Not affected by effects requiring hearing</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dominated</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When damaged, can make saving throw against domination, condition
          ends on successful save</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cannot take actions</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dominator can spend a move action to make the dominated character
          move its speed. This counts as forced movement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dominator can spend a standard action to make the dominated character
          use an at-will attack. This counts as a forced attack.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sidebar: Forced attack</p>
    <p>Certain powers or effects allow one character to force an enemy to make
      an attack. Such attacks are considered forced attacks, and use the
      following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If there are different attack powers that meet the requirement for
            the forced attack (e.g. basic attacks or at-will attacks), the
            character forcing the attack is aware of all available options and
            can choose any of them. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For the chosen attack power, the character forcing the attack can
            make any relevant decision, including (but not limited to) targets,
            area of effect, forced movement caused by the attack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A character forced to make an attack cannot target himself with the
            forced attack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Forced attacks ignore the marked condition. A character making a
            forced attack counts as not marked, for the purposes of that attack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Forced attacks never trigger opportunity attacks.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Grabbed</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When grabbed, character is pulled adjacent to grabber</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Condition ends if at any time the character is not adjacent to
          grabber</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Can spend a move action to make an Escape Check (see sidebar). If
          successful, condition ends.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cannot move</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If forced movement would cause the character and the grabber to no
          longer be adjacent, character can make an Escape Check (see sidebar)
          as a free action. If successful, condition ends. If the check fails or
          is not taken, the forced movement is negated.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sidebar: Escape Check</p>
    <p>Characters can make Escape Checks to end conditions like Grabbed or
      Swallowed, usually by spending a move action.</p>
    <p>Check: choose one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Acrobatics vs Reflex of condition source</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Athletics vs Fortitude of condition source</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Helpless</p>

      </li>

        <p>Can be attacked with Coup de Grace</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Immobilized</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Cannot move</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Marked</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>-2 mark penalty to attack rolls of attacks that violate mark (see
          sidebar)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sidebar: Violating marks</p>
    <p>An attack violates a mark if it targets one or more enemies and does not
      include the marker as a target. The following exceptions apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If multiple attacks are made simultaneously as part of the same
            attack power, none of the attacks violate the mark as long as the
            marker is the target of at least one attack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If multiple attacks are made in sequence as part of the same attack
            power (e.g. primary and secondary attacks), once an attack is made
            that includes the marker as a target, none of the subsequent attacks
            violate the mark.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If an attack initially includes the marker as a target and is later
            prevented from including the marker as a target by an effect
            controlled by an enemy (e.g. a power changing attack targets), this
            attack does not violate the mark.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If a character is marked while making an attack (e.g. by an
            Interrupt power that marks), that attack does not violate the mark.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Any power or effect that triggers when a marked character makes an
      attack that does not include the marking character as a target should be
      updated to trigger when a marked character makes an attack that violates
      the mark, and use the rules described above.</p>
    <p>Sidebar: Defender Aura</p>
    <p>The text on defender aura should be replaced with the following:</p>
    <p>“Enemies in the aura are marked”</p>
    <p>(Note that the new rules for stacking conditions mean that a mark no
      longer overrides other marks or defender auras, and a character can be
      simultaneously marked by multiple enemies).</p>

        <p>Gains Resist (all) [Note: New rules for resistances will be added in
          a future article. For the purposes of this condition, read this as

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Condition lasts indefinitely until character stands up</p>
      </li>

        <p>Character can use a move action to stand up. This ends the condition,
          and lets the character move 1 square afterward.</p>

      </li>
      <li>

          rolls) or, if already in Cover, gains Total Cover (-5 cover penalty to
          attack rolls)</p>

        <p>-2 power penalty to attack rolls</p>

    <p>Exiled (was “Removed from Game”)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When exiled, a character disappears from its current position. When
          the condition ends, the character reappears on this position or, if
          not possible, in the closest ground square of his choice, unless the
          exiling effect states otherwise.</p>
